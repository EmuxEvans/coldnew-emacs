Commentary:

This projects contains all the necessary functions and macros, taken from
cc-mode, to implement hungry deletion without relying on cc-mode.  This
allows it to be used more easily in all modes, as it is now a minor mode in
it's own right.  global-hungry-delete-mode will turn on hungry-delete-mode in
all buffers.

To use this mode, just put the following in your .emacs file:

(require 'hungry-delete)
(global-hungry-delete-mode)
