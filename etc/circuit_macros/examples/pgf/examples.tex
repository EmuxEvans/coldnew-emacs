  In this directory the source files are processed with m4, dpic -g,
  and TikZ PGF.
  This is a collection of diagrams the author has had occasion to
  produce using m4 circuit macros and others, and gpic or dpic.  The
  source-file names are shown for reference.  There may be other or
  better m4 or pic constructs for producing the same drawings in some
  cases.
