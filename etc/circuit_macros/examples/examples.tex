  This is a collection of diagrams the author has had occasion to
  produce using m4 circuit macros and others, and gpic or dpic.  In
  some cases, there are other or better m4 or pic constructs for
  producing the same drawings, but the source-file names are shown for
  reference.  Most of the examples can be processed using either
  dpic~-p or gpic~-t, which has meant that in a few cases the source is
  slightly more complicated than it would be if only one processor had
  been assumed.
