% This is the main examples file with a few diagrams omitted.
  In this directory the source file are processed with m4, dpic -s,
  and MetaPost. 
  This is a collection of diagrams the author has had occasion to
  produce using m4 circuit macros and others, and gpic or dpic.  In
  some cases, there are other or better m4 or pic constructs for
  producing the same drawings, but the source-file names are shown for
  reference.

  Click on the link to browse the source of each diagram and
  read the manual CMman.pdf for a complete explanation.
