THIS DIRECTORY contains a Makefile and test files for the MetaPost
output of dpic.

1.  On a Unix-like system, typing "make" processes the examples file
  and the diagrams it includes to produce examples.ps.  Each diagram is
  passed through m4, dpic, and MetaPost, and then is imported into
  examples.tex by the \includegraphics macro.  On MikTeX, check the MKDIM
  definition in the Makefile before typing "make".

2.  To work on a single file, copy the source into test.m4 and
  type make tst.  The files test.pic, test.mp, test.1, tst.dvi, and tst.ps
  will be created.
