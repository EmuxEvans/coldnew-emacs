This directory contains examples.tex and source files for the diagrams
that are imported when examples.tex is LaTeXed. To generate examples.ps
in a unix-like environment (versions of unix, linux, cygwin, djgpp, ...):

1.  Install the libraries as described in the top-level README file.
2.  In this directory, type "make".

To test one of the diagrams, say ex01.m4, type one of the following
"make ex01.ps"
"make ex01.eps"
"make ex01.pdf" (uses pdflatex)
"make ex01.png" (uses Imagemagick convert)

To test and debug a single diagram, write it into test.m4.  Type
"make tst" to process the file, creating test.tex, which is imported into
tst.tex.  The diagram source and tst.tex are processed twice in case
the boxdim macro is being used.  If you only need to process once, type
"make tst1".  In both cases the resulting file is tst.ps.

To test and debug a single diagram in a different directory, copy Makefile
and tst.tex to where you want to work, adjust the definition of LIBDIR
in Makefile, and type one of the above commands.

By default, the dpic processor is invoked, producing PSTricks commands.

To process the diagrams using TikZ PGF for processing either by LaTeX or
PDFlatex, look in the pgf subdirectory.

To process the diagrams using .eps intermediate files with embedded psfrag
strings, go into the psfrag directory and read the README file.

To produce pdf files with MetaPost and pdflatex, go to the pdflatex
subdirectory and read the README file.

To process the diagrams using MetaPost, look in the mpost subdirectory.

The xfig subdirectory contains the file xfig/xfiglib.fig, which contains
elements in xfig 3.2 format produced by dpic for importing into xfig.
