;;; Commentary:

;; These are extensions to Emacs Lisp that provide a degree of
;; Common Lisp compatibility, beyond what is already built-in
;; in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; This package was written by Dave Gillespie; it is a complete
;; rewrite of Cesar Quiroz's original cl.el package of December 1986.
;;
;; Bug reports, comments, and suggestions are welcome!

;; This file contains the portions of the Common Lisp extensions
;; package which should always be present.
