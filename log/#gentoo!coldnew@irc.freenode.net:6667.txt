<tdr> jonwil, find /boot/grub/grub.conf
<tdr> jonwil, then you can tell it to use the config  [16:00]
<jonwil> ok, find /boot/grub/grub.conf says (hd0,0)
<tdr> configfile (hd0,0)/boot/grub/grub.conf
<jonwil> ok, thats booting  [16:01]
<jonwil> once it boots, what do I do to fix grub so it doesn't have the problem
	 again?
<tdr> jonwil, do you use the grub shell or the grub-install thing?
<jonwil> grub-install
<tdr> urgh
<tdr> i'd use:  grub <enter>  root (hd0,0) <enter>  setup (hd0) <enter>  quit
<jonwil> ok  [16:02]
<tdr> shell++
<jonwil> if you say thats better then I will do that

<crooksey_> How can I give a user permanent access to specific socket?  [16:19]
<mapee> maybe im blind or dunno but can't see in the docs, what genkernel flag
	should i use to only build drivers relevant to my hardware?  [16:37]
<crooksey_> mapee: you cant build exactly for your hardware only  [16:38]
<Phr33d0m> mapee there's no such magic available currently :)
<DrEeevil> mapee: just build the kernel manually and then use "genkernel
	   initramfs" :)
<crooksey_> you can use genkernel make menuconfig to specify any options other
	    than the default  [16:39]

<mapee> shadok, i used lspci but know that too thanks  [16:49]
<shadok> mapee: and menuconfig has a search included (hit '/') and per-module
	 help such as you can find the default values and a little explanation
	 each time
<mapee> nice :)
<shadok> for help on a module hit "h"
<mapee> okay, thanks again :)
<shadok> and make sure you backup your config before rebooting, working
	 incrementally until everything works is my preferred way to do that
									  [16:50]
<shadok> np :)

	suggest me howto partition it's 80gb hdd? it would like to use it for

<Caplain> its for python

<mapee> handbook says edit make.conf at /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/make.conf but
	there is no such thing, just at /mnt/gentoo/etc/make.conf, should i
	mv/cp it ?  [19:34]
<Tucos> both work, as per make.conf(5): "Both /etc/make.conf and

<Barbariandude> Hi guys, I just set up a custom ebuild which requires a local
		file containing the .deb it installs from. Where am I supposed
		to place this .deb for portage to be able to access it?
<Barbariandude> More specifically, where does SRC_URI in an .ebuild file refer
		to?  [20:44]
<violetina> benneh: hmm that seems all fine , did you have a look at dmesg yet
	    (or messages)
<benneh> violetina: i looked at /var/log/messages, but it hasn't had anything
	 written to it for ~2 weeks :/  [20:45]
<violetina> benneh: if you dont start X does the laptop hang too (you can boot
	    with nox in grub kernel line line to do that)  [20:46]
<shadok> Barbariandude: it refers to the file download URI
<benneh> violetina: yes, i can boot fine without starting xdm
<violetina> benneh: serious that isnt normal it should log :x
<benneh> violetina: i know :/, but i'm looking at it now and the last line is
	 dated Aug 10
<violetina> benneh: dont you have syslog-ng or so? and is the service started?
<benneh> violetina: it is running at the moment  [20:48]
<benneh> violetina: i get a warning about the opt variable being deprecated, is
	 that anything to do with this?
<violetina> dont think so  [20:49]
<shadok> Barbariandude: if the file is already in distfiles portage should find
	 it directly
<violetina> benneh: anything funky in you xorg.conf?  [20:50]
<benneh> violetina: just the result of nvidia-xconfig with the empty sections
	 removed; i can show you if you want to see it
<benneh> violetina: also Load "glx" and Disable "dri" and Disable "dri2" added
	 to the module section  [20:51]
<violetina> yoou may but i doubt it is the cause :x
<benneh> violetina: http://bpaste.net/show/41509/
<benneh> violetina: except when i use the nvidia drivers, none of it is
	 commented out :P  [20:52]
<violetina> benneh: only device section should be enough btw  [20:53]
<violetina> but i dont think this cause your issue
<violetina> and with no real error log it aint easy to pinpoint either :s
									  [20:54]
<benneh> violetina: i'll see if i can remove it later when this is fixed then
<violetina> benneh: what DE you using?
<benneh> violetina: yeah, the consensus so far has been that there doesn't seem
	 to be any reported problem anywhere :/
<benneh> violetina: gnome 2
<benneh> violetina: would testing a simpler DE help? that's been suggested
									  [20:55]
<benneh> just in case it's a problem with gnome
<violetina> tried to see if just an xsession crashes it too yet? mean no wm no
	    DE
<violetina> something like xinit /usr/bin/xterm  [20:56]
<benneh> violetina: not yet, i can try that in a minute
<violetina> or just startx that will use twm
<benneh> ok i'll reboot and see what happens when i try that  [20:57]
<benneh> thanks for the help, i'll report back later :)
<violetina> good i'll be off a bit tho i guess , need to shop for food and eat
	    something .. but good luck  [20:58]

<Patagonicus> sambagirl: You don’t have to use a different laptop, Gentoo works
	      fine on 32bit hardware
<sambagirl> ok  [23:57]
<sambagirl> bbiab have to read this
<sambagirl> thanks
<UQlev> Patagonicus: fine but slow
<iamben> UQlev: linux runs slower on slower/older hardware, i think we all know
	 that  [23:58]

[Thu Aug 23 2012]
<pakaran> iamben: out of sheer curiousity, what is the minimum hardware for
	  Gentoo?  can you run it on a 386 if you're willing to wait several
	  months for e.g. x.org to compile?  [00:01]
<iamben> to use the stock stages you need at least 486, i386 isn't supported
	 since we moved to nptl-only  [00:02]
<pakaran> nod  [00:03]
* funfool has a p-1 running knoppix, would be fun to put gentoo on it
<pakaran> and, of course, saying performance will be an issue on a 486 is an
	  understatement.  A 486/100 is probably close to 2 orders slower than a
	  new chip, especially for compiling, which parallelizes well.

*** jexo_ (~jexo@dsbg-d9bb1d95.pool.mediaWays.net) is now known as jexo  [00:06]
<nuffigel> so does anyones /usr/include/libpurple/media.h also #include the
	   nonexistent "media/candidates.h" ?  [00:07]
<pavlix> hi folks, what's the best runtime test to know wheter systemd or openrc
	 is used?  [00:08]
<tdr> pavlix, did you install systemd?  [00:10]
<pavlix> tdr: I'm not on Gentoo but I'm reading gentoo-specific code of
	 NetworkManager
<tdr> pavlix, oh, so you are wanting a service to  be able to test which is in
      use?  [00:11]
<pavlix> tdr: it's acutally checking for openrc vs systemd in some way and then
	 using either of them for starting up the lo interface
<pavlix> I don't know exactly why we *need* specific ways for specific distros
	 but I don't want to break it for you while refactoring :)  [00:12]
<pavlix> tdr: yep
<pavlix> tdr: maybe I asked the wrong quetion and should have right out ask for
	 the generic way to enable lo on both openrc and systemd based Gentoo
	 systems  [00:13]
<mingdao> pavlix: You might join #openrc for more discussion about this.
<iamben> it's a very good question, i'm just not sure who can answer it =)  the
	 openrc folks will say "what do i know about systemd?" and the systemd
	 folks will say "what do i know about openrc?"  [00:14]
<Vinky> dumb question, but do NM need to start lo?  [00:15]
<iamben> Vinky: on all the systems where i use NM, i allow gentoo's net.lo to
	 start lo, and NM manages all others
<Vinky> same here but for wicd
<pavlix> Vinky: it's a network configuration daemon and it is expected to put
	 the networking in a good state  [00:16]
<pavlix> Vinky: you're doing it right but NM can be used without other net
	 configuration tools
<Vinky> okay  [00:20]
<ov3rmind> hi guys! anyone use lmms under gentoo?
<violetina> ov3rmind: the fruityloops clone?  [00:21]
<violetina> think i played with it but years ago so not sure i can help :x
									  [00:22]
<ov3rmind> i don't kbnown fruitloops but maybe is it
<rypervenche> ov3rmind: I've got it, but I haven't used it yet.
<ov3rmind> i have found some trouble to emerge it building zyaddstubfx module?
<ov3rmind> zynaddsubfx  [00:23]
<ov3rmind> i have installed media-sound zynaddsubfx but lmms canoot build the
	   module  [00:24]
<violetina> ov3rmind: tried the proaudio overlay yet?
<ov3rmind> no
<ov3rmind> you recomend i use proaudio overlay?
<jarray52> I ran emerge portage, and portage could not resolve the host. Here
	   are the output errors. http://pastebin.com/EyN9C6bP
<violetina> last time i checked zynaddsubfx was kind of dead project not sure
	    how it is now tho  [00:25]
<violetina> ov3rmind: yes
<ov3rmind> ok
<ov3rmind> i try use it
<ov3rmind> very thanks
<violetina> ov3rmind: just a thought did not dig in the ebuild , but maybe when
	    you use the fluidsynth use for it it not needs
	    media-sound/zynaddsubfx  [00:27]
<iamben> jarray52: did you just chroot?
<violetina> let me try to build it agin too ;)
<tdr> jarray52, is your /etc/resolv.conf empty?  [00:28]
<sambagirl> ok i'm stupid about gentoo. my question is this. i see a
	    livedvd-x86-amd64-32ul-2012.iso for download.  my quesion is
	    this. is thie an ok image to burn for that 32 bit laptop i eluded to
	    earlier? secondly will i be able to do a install via that dvd image?
									  [00:29]
<sambagirl> i guess i will know when i do it i guess.  [00:31]
<iamben> sambagirl: yes, that one can boot on 32bit or 64bit, it defaults to
	 32bit
<jarray52> tdr: No. It is not empty.
<violetina> yes and yes sambagirl ;)
<sambagirl> thanks
<iamben> jarray52: sounds like you just aren't online
<violetina> sambagirl: btw you can use any linux livecd you are comfortable with
	    to install gentoo  [00:32]
<jarray52> iamben: I ran emerge portage again. And, this time it worked.  [00:33]
<sambagirl> well violetina i suppose what has me confounded is that i had always
	    been led to believe that gentoo was an os in itself. yet looking at
	    all the stages and handbooks and stuff on the site, i'm confused?
	    and it even seem wierder to me that i can use anything to install
	    it? i don't really understand what i am getting myself into but i'm
	    going to find out shortly i guess.
<iamben> jarray52: probably just a network/internet connectivity hiccup then
<kollapse> Hi. I have 2 systems neworked via firewire but I suspect the link
	   might be damaged as I get a huge amount of NFS stalls, freezes and
	   whatnot. Is there any way I can check the link or otherwise diagnose
	   the problem?  [00:34]
<iamben> sambagirl: during the gentoo install, you create some partitions &
	 filesystems, unpack a stage3 tarball there, chroot into it, edit some
	 configs & build a few things, then boot into it.  that's a rough
	 summary of the process.
<violetina> sambagirl: gentoo has no installer , you are the installer , you
	    need a shell (bash) and the handbook and diskspace , and some logic
	    to install gentoo
<violetina> ov3rmind: it did install fine here :x  [00:35]
<violetina> ov3rmind: which use flags you tried and can you paste the buildlog ?
	    btw i did build the one from portage tree
<sambagirl> violetina so it's a thinkers os, ok, well i'll just go thru the
	    process and see if i am up to the task :)  [00:37]
<violetina> sambagirl: good :)
<sambagirl> took only 3 min to download so i'll burn it and see what i can do
	    thank. hope to be back here on that laptop in awhile. peace
									  [00:38]
<violetina> sambagirl: the handbook is quite good and if you get stuck just ask
	    here
<sambagirl> ok
<markand> hello  [00:41]
<markand> I used to go on gpo.zugaina.org to see which overlay give what  [00:42]
<markand> but now I don't know how to search through the overlay :(  [00:43]
<violetina> markand: eix-remote can help out  [00:44]
<violetina> markand: at cost of havving a quite bulky eix output tho
<markand> thanks I check  [00:45]
<litwol> hmm  [00:47]
<iamben> litwol: i was thinking the same thing  [00:55]
<litwol> iamben: :)  [00:56]
<litwol> i always forget i grew out of the old annoying behavior of "zomg lemme
	 ask some one else to solve my problem", and i only get to remember it
	 after i've already typed someting into a channel i know has my
	 answers... but then i catch myself and redirect my hmming to google or
	 something.  [00:57]
*** Vasco_O (vasco_O@LOOK.MOM.I.AM.ON.TEH.INTARD.NET) is now known as Vasco
									  [01:01]
<markand> yesterday I could not figure out how to fix that :
	  http://pastebin.com/P51FFBBf  [01:04]
<markand> I don't really understand the use-dependency problem here
<hasufell> yeah, REQUIRED_USE messages are very ugly  [01:05]
<hasufell> markand: do you have "mikmod" enabled for sdl-mixer?  [01:06]
<hasufell> actually "mikmod" and "mod"  [01:07]
<iamben> seems like a minor portage bug, there is no reason it should say "this
	 change violates.. ", it should just say "Change USE: +mikmod +mod"
<violetina> never seen that one yet :x  [01:08]
<iamben> usually the "this change violates" stuff comes up when there's an
	 exactly-one-of USE requirement
<hasufell> required_use messages don't really tell the user what to do  [01:09]
<hasufell> :/
<hasufell> it should be converted into a readable format  [01:10]
<iamben> normally they are quite readable, i think
<hasufell> for me too, but from the user feedback I think not
<iamben> it doesn't give very usable output here, because of the supposed
	 conflict
<hasufell> in any case it prints this mess of useflag foo? ( any-of ( wtf bro) )
									  [01:11]
<hasufell> ^^
<iamben> normally above that woudl be single "foo? bar" line, followed by the
	 full set of requirements for reference only  [01:12]
<markand> hasufell, it's not the REQUIRED_USE it's the couple of ( ) that
	  follows
<iamben> anyway i think i will report this one, seems like one where zmedico
	 will say "yep it's a minor bug in <foo> function, fixed now"  within
	 about 2 hours
<markand> iamben, usually when a missing use, portage just says Change USE:
	  +whatever  [01:13]
<markand> here it's something more complex
<iamben> markand: there is a problem with teh REQUIRED_USE logic, what it wants
	 is Change USE: +mikmod +mod but for some reason, it thinks this will
	 create a conflict
<neodragon> my apologies, I am learning this stuff as I go along. I am playing
	    around with a git repo I found on github that contains the ebuild
	    for compiz-fusion 0.9.8. I successfully created a github account and
	    cloned that repo to my local /usr/portage/myrepos folder and I have
	    also configured git as well, but what I am trying to find a doc on
	    how to create an overlay .xml file, does anyone know where I can
	    find such a doc
<markand> okay  [01:14]
<markand> I added mikmod and mod and it works
<markand> thanks
<violetina> neodragon: http://layman.sourceforge.net/#_overlay_lists_2  not sure
	    that is what you mean  [01:18]
<uehto> how do I find out the socket://hostname for my printer?  [01:19]
<uehto> (its connected through usb)
<hasufell> iamben: portage apparently checks only for the use-flag dependencies
	   specified in the targeted ebuild and does not resolve further
	   constraints by the dependency ebuild
<hypnocat> i'm trying to get a useful backtrace from a program ("patchage")
	   that's segfaulted on me.. gentoo normally generates a stripped binary
	   of it, so i've added "-ggdb3" to my CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS and added
	   "splitdebug" to my FEATURES in /etc/make.conf, and now i see that the
	   emerge of patchage has created a
	   /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/patchage.debug which is not stripped
<hasufell> but that is worth a bug report yeah
<iamben> uehto: you won't use socket:// for usb printers  [01:20]
<hypnocat> but i still can't get a useful backtrace.. when i run gdb on the core
	   file, the backtrace looks like:  "#0  0x00007f46705861d1 in ?? ()"
<uehto> iamben, then what do I do in the cups web interface in the "Connection"
	text box?  [01:21]
<hypnocat> the /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/patchage.debug that emerge generates has
	   644 permissions.. i've tried changing them to 755 and running it, but
	   i get an error:  "zsh: exec format error:
	   /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/patchage.debug"
<iamben> uehto: that's for networked printers only
<hypnocat> so i guess that file contains just debugging symbols.. but how can i
	   get gdb to use them?
<uehto> iamben, then why does it take me to that when I select the only "local
	printer" (named "hplip")  [01:22]
<iamben> uehto: i believe it should list a specific USB printer under local, if

<hasufell> jarray52: they may just be dependencies  [01:43]
<jarray52> hasufell: In the link you sent, the file is called
	   package.accept_keywords not package.keywords. Has the name changed in
	   the most recent portage version?  [01:45]
<iamben> jarray52: both are valid, the former is the new/preferred location

<neodragon> ok aparently I am doing this wrong. I cloned what I thought was the

	    just the portion of the repo that has the ebuild scripts, good grief
	    I wish I knew how to properly set this up  [01:47]
<baccenfutter> neodragon: you might want to consult `man ebuild`  [01:48]

<neodragon> OK here is an easier question. There is already an official over
	    called fm-overlay that has the ebuilds for both compiz-fusion 0.9.7
	    and 0.9.8, I tried to install the 0.9.7 from that and even though I
	    setup the portage.keywords file correctly portage kept wanting to
	    pulling compiz-0.9.8-r'something' while everything else for compiz
	    was the 0.9.7 versions and because of the version miss match there
	    were blocking issues  [01:54]
<violetina> hmm i havr PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/mnt/MEDIA/portage" why do i get > Source
	    unpacked in /mnt/MEDIA/portage/portage/.....  [01:55]
<neodragon> how do I get portage to ignore the 0.9.8 version of the compiz
	    package and only pull in the 0.9.7 version of it like it was doing
	    for all the other packages i.e. compiz-fusion, libcompizconfig,
	    compiz-plugins-main etc  [01:56]
<khayyam> violetina: that default is PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/var/tmp" so no need to

<ykaeb> hello mates
<rypervenche> jarray52: What do you mean?  [02:06]
<ykaeb> I'm thinking of installing gentoo on my 1.6GHz Intel Atom machine with
	1GB of core. Has anyone else done it?
<jarray52> I moved, and there's a lot of unable to resolve host address... when
	   I run tail -f /var/log/emerge-fetch.log
<jarray52> ykaeb: That might be painful unless you plan to do an extremely
	   minimal install.  [02:07]
<verty_> incredibly silly thing happening now, ghostscript-gpl was built with
	 cups enabled, but now that has changed, so it should build without cups
	 now, but it needs cups, which needs cups-filters, which needs
	 ghostscript-gpl[cups], so cups is being enabled on ghostscript-gpl
<verty_> but all it needs to do is rebuild ghostscript-gpl without cups, so cups
	 and cups-filters can be removed, and I have already unmerged them
									  [02:08]
<jarray52> ykaeb: Gentoo builds everything from source. So, that might take days

<verty_> so instead of just building ghostscript-gpl as I have told it to, it
	 enabled cups
<a3li> jarray52: but you can fetch the distfiles after all?
<verty_> enables*
<verty_> definite logic error in emerge, I'll file a bug report
<jarray52> a3li: Not sure.
<jarray52> a3li: I'm on 1 of 396.  [02:09]
<a3li> jarray52: I guess emerge should have aborted by now if it missed files
<jarray52> a3li: And, I had 10 failures and then a success(just now).
<a3li> jarray52: that's somewhat expected. there might be outdated or
       unavailable mirrors  [02:10]
<jarray52> a3li: The failures are decreasing, and the speed improved.
<a3li> verty_: so you've come here to tell us that you're filing a bug report?
       or did you want us to maybe give you a solution?
<kutsuya> Is nickserv missing?  [02:11]

<latenite> Hi folks, I am installing gentoo on a new box. First thing I do is
	   install eix But that fails with https://gist.github.com/3428056 I am
	   a little lost on how to fix that...
<rypervenche> Could I get a little help with why I am unable to compile tuxnes?
	      http://bpaste.net/show/41563/  [02:12]
<verty_> a3li: I'll show you output
<a3li> latenite: does installing other packages work? this looks like a somewhat
       broken filesystem mount
<latenite> a3li, I tried "pciutils" that went trhough just fine  [02:13]
<Phr33d0m> can anyone tell me what happened to portage's caching after --sync?
									  [02:14]
<latenite> a3li, that hint helped. I am in a chroot and forgot to mount
	   /proc. Now it works fine. thanks a lot  [02:15]
<johnfg_> is busybox needed for a 'standard' gentoo system?  [02:17]
<a3li> latenite: cool
<johnfg_> I think I must have looked into it and installed it, but have never
	  used it.  So, will plan to remove it.  [02:18]
<meingtsla> johnfg_: You might be able to get away with force unmerging it
<khayyam> johnfg_: its needed for 'single' I believe
<meingtsla> It is part of the base profile I believe
<meingtsla> Oh
<meingtsla> Never mind then!
<frostschutz> johnfg_: it's used for initrd/initramfs. not so much for the
	      system itself but it can be a nice fallback when something goes
	      wrong.
<verty_> a3li: here is the problem: http://pastebin.com/0JH9bC51 .  It looks
	 like a bug in emerge to me.  [02:19]
<verty_> back in 2 minutes
<johnfg_> So, maybe I didn't install it, but it's part of my genkernel system?
<frostschutz> johnfg_: you probably don't want to uninstall it unless you're
	      that tight on space you have to free the 2-3MB it uses ;)
									  [02:20]
<johnfg_> frostschutz: k.  I'm not that tight, so...
<ufoman> johnfg_: it saves you from emerging dhcp client for example ;)  [02:22]
<ufoman> as it has udhcpc applet
<khayyam> johnfg_: the only thing that depends on it is
	  virtual/dev-manager-0[mdev]
<nilsatchara> I can't get eclipse-sdk from the "seden" overlay to install.  I've
	      looked through the build log and don't see anything obvious.  I'm
	      using an overlay version because the Android toolkit requires a
	      version > 3.6 and the base gentoo package is only 3.5.
									  [02:23]
<johnfg_> k, thanks guys.  [02:24]
<khayyam> johnfg_: its only 2.89mb :)
<verty_> a3li: ghostscript-gpl should not want to build with cups, period
<hasufell> verty_: unfortunately cups useflag is in releases/make.defaults
									  [02:25]
<hasufell> which does not make any sense  [02:26]
<ykaeb> what's the difference between the stages of gentoo installation?
<verty_> hasufell: but I have disabled it in make.conf
<khayyam> ykaeb: you mean stage tarballs or stages of the install?  [02:27]
<verty_> I'm going to look at each ebuild to see if anything is pulling in cups
<ykaeb> stage tarballs
<khayyam> ykaeb: stage1 (obsolete), stage2 (obsolete) statge3 (current base)
									  [02:28]
<Oliver`> What's the best way about defining default applications for opening
	  images/RARs/etc. from the Firefox download menu?
<Oliver`> best way to go about*  [02:29]
<khayyam> ykaeb: I could go into more detail ... bst as stage3 is the supported
	  stage
<ykaeb> I've downloaded systemrescueCD and loaded it into the netbook. hope I
	don't mess this up! what mistakes do newbies usually make when
	installing gentoo?  [02:30]
<rypervenche> ykaeb: Just follow the directions in the guide.^^
<a3li> verty_: your currently installed ghostscript-gpl has USE=cups
       enabled. cups is in its build-time dependencies
<khayyam> ykaeb: well, one bug you may run into with sysrescuecd is the 'unset
	  path' bug
<a3li> verty_: likely fixable with emerge -1  [02:31]
<a3li> verty_: (of ghostscript-gpl)
<rypervenche> Could I get a little help with why I am unable to compile tuxnes?
	      http://bpaste.net/show/41563/
<khayyam> ykaeb: not sure if its fixed or not ... but once you chroot you should
	  type 'unset path'
<ykaeb> right
<khayyam> ykaeb: if emerging libtool dies then its due to the above  [02:32]
<verty_> a3li: I think the problem is it doesn't see that ghostscript-gpl needs
	 to be rebuilt, as emerge -Nv world shows, I also tried emerge -v
	 --changed-use world, same thing.  So it doesn't act on that and assumes
	 ghostscript-gpl will remain with cups enabled  [02:33]
<ykaeb> is an intel Atom an i486 or an i686 machine?  [02:34]
<liuml07> Hi, anyone here who uses the gentoo-prefix at Mac OSX?
<khayyam> ykaeb: do not change the CHOST
<a3li> liuml07: #gentoo-prefix is the best place to ask  [02:35]
<liuml07> I'd like to know how to run 'revdep-rebuild' at gentoo-prefix ?
<verty_> a3li: but it is possible I installed ghostscript-gpl from a quickpkg
	 binary from another machine, so could have confused the situation,
	 probably not bug worthy
<chithead> it is i686 and if /proc/cpuinfo shows the "lm" flag, amd64  [02:36]
<liuml07> Thank you, a3li
<ykaeb> uname -a tells me it's i586 :(  [02:37]
<ykaeb> o wait it says i686! ^^  [02:38]
<rypervenche> ^^
<ykaeb> http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-785849-start-0.html looks like
	someone else installed gentoo on the same machine
*** PennStater` (~Aaron@8.225.195.144) is now known as PennStater
<a3li> verty_: maybe the binary is causing this, still you need a installed
       version with -cups, or the package not installed for the dependency to
       not kick in. all in all not a portage bug  [02:39]
<verty_> a3li: that is wrong though, that it installs the old dependency, there
	 is nothing stopping it building ghostscript-gpl first to remove the
	 dep, so cups is not required  [02:40]
<khayyam> verty_: I uninstalled cups a month or so back and revdep-rebuild
	  rebuilt ghostscipt-gpl with USE="-cups"  [02:41]
<verty_> a3li: I'm going to test this, I'll build ghostscript-gpl without cups,
	 then with cups, then try again
<verty_> khayyam: thanks  [02:42]
<khayyam> verty_: np
*** Rez (lorez@freenode/staff/LoRez) is now known as LoRez
<rypervenche> ykaeb: I'm on an Intel Atom too^^
<verty_> khayyam: I'll test it to make absolutely sure anyway; if it fails, I'll
	 look into the emerge code to see if I can suggest a fix on
	 bugs.gentoo.org  [02:43]
<ykaeb> The intel atom's not anemic, but I think it will still take ages to
	build everything.
<ykaeb> does it?  [02:44]
<verty_> ykaeb: that depends on many factors like pipeline length and cache
	 size, not just clock speed so hard to know
<khayyam> verty_: ok, well this was only a month or so back, I simply set -cup
	  in my useflags unmerged cups and did a revdep-rebuild, of course
	  things change so ymmv  [02:45]
<khayyam> ykaeb: how long is a peice of string? :)
<verty_> khayyam: ok, that would have avoided this issue where emerge includes a
	 dependency that is about to be removed in the same emerge
<rypervenche> ykaeb: I don't have any problems on my little EeePC.  [02:46]
<khayyam> rypervenche: you must have tiny fingers :)  [02:47]
<rypervenche> ykaeb: Most things compile quickly enough. Libre office took 14
	      hours though.  [02:48]
*** slaytani1 (~slaytanic@2001:470:d845::2:2) is now known as slaytanic
<khayyam> verty_: yes, but portage operates on currently installed
	  packages/dependencys ... these will remain *if* revdep-reuild isn't
	  used  [02:49]
<ykaeb> should I go with MBR or GPT?  [02:50]
<khayyam> ykaeb: GPT would be my preference
<rypervenche> I use MBR.
<verty_> khayyam: the original situation was, ghostscript-gpl had cups enabled,
	 which pulled in cups, which pulled in cups-filters, which pulled in
	 ghostscript-gpl[cups], a loop of dependencies.  There was no obvious
	 way to fix it, but a good idea was to remove cups and cups-filters,
	 then change ghostscript-gpl to -cups, then try to update
<verty_> khayyam: now it looks like the way to fix it is force-remove cups +
	 cups-filters, change the use on ghostscript-gpl, revdep-rebuild because
	 emerge will get confused, then emerge  [02:51]
<nilsatchara> ykaeb: Once you  [02:52]
<khayyam> verty_: I'm having difficulty following the logic there if, as you
	  say, ghostscript-gpl "had cups" then ghostscript-gpl[cups] is met
<ykaeb> does gentoo use GRUB2?  [02:53]
<UndrWater> anyone find a good google drive client?
<verty_> khayyam: ghostscript-gpl couldn't change to -cups while cups-filters
	 was installed.  cups-filters was used by cups.  so cups had to go.
	 without cups and cups-filters, nothing should stop ghostscript-gpl from
	 becoming -cups, but unfortunately, emerge can't work that out
<Vinky> ykaeb, it can if you chose to :-)
<khayyam> ykaeb: it does if you choose to emerge it .. but there are other EFI
	  capable bootloaders/managers
<theadmin> Alright, I'm ready to do a *real* install tomorrow. The process of
	   understanding Gentoo with over 6 reinstalls was painful, but was
	   worth it.  [02:54]
<nilsatchara> ykaeb: Once you've booted the SystemRescueCD, a "cat
	      /proc/cpuinfo" will give you the Atom's capabilities.  If one of
	      the flags is "lm", it is capable of running a 64-bit OS.
<verty_> khayyam: ( because emerge pulls in cups and cups-filters to satisfy
	 ghostscript-gpl[cups], which was there, but should not be used)
<verty_> I want to fix emerge, is the thing
<theannihilator> if i install android_sdk_update_manager will that give me adb
		 support?  [02:55]
<verty_> khayyam: but on the other hand, I can sort of understand emerge
	 assuming that any installed package is not broken, and if
	 ghostscript-gpl[cups] is installed, then cups is installed  [02:56]
<verty_> khayyam: but I hope something better is possible
<khayyam> verty_: I'm still having difficulty seeing where this is broken, I can
	  see that emerge is trying to fix its dependencies, but this would have
	  been fixed by a revdep-rebuild once cups is nolonger there and -cups
	  is in place
<ykaeb> should I go with xfs or ext4?  [02:57]
<khayyam> ykaeb: you have the choice :)
<verty_> ykaeb: that's up to you but I have had no trouble with xfs, very
	 reliable
<verty_> ykaeb: it does the journal stuff on boot and voila, works  [02:58]
<khayyam> ykaeb: I used ext2, ext4 and xfs
<verty_> ykaeb: one thing to consider is also having ext2 volumes for when you
	 have many temporary files, because xfs is linear per file, if you know
	 what I mean, time proportional to number of files
<khayyam> ykaeb: s/used/use/
<verty_> ykaeb: so I have /var as ext2  [02:59]
<ykaeb> right
<verty_> ykaeb: but the upside is, the state is always consistent  [03:00]
<ykaeb> alright now to untar the stage3 package
<[GuS]> Hi guys, i have problems by emerging su-jdk-6u33, since it does not
	exist anymore in Oracle download page. Just su-jdk-6u34 but there is not
	ebuild for that.  [03:01]
<rypervenche> ykaeb: Don't forget the "p" when untarring^^
<markand> how can I set a LINGUAS variable for only some package ?
<verty_> ykaeb: for few large files, xfs is really good, but for say > 10000
	 files, it slows down
<verty_> untarring, etc
<theadmin> [GuS]: Why not make one? Take the existing ebuild, put it in your
	   local overlay (for example), re-manifest it and maybe modify to fit
	   the new version.  [03:02]
<khayyam> [GuS]: you could move the ebuild to PORTAGE_OVERLAY and bump ..
<[GuS]> theadmin: i'bve created one, but i  cant wget the file directly to the
	server and i dont have X in there :P  [03:03]
<ykaeb> oh no I forgot the p
<theadmin> [GuS]: Hm, where's such file located? I can reupload it somewhere.
<iamben> [GuS]: so fetch it locally and scp it over
<verty_> ykaeb: delete it all and try again :)  [03:04]
<[GuS]> iamben:  i know that... but i am at work and our bw is not good...
<[GuS]> and if i do so, i put so slow all the net here...
*** killerbo1 (~mateusz@217.17.38.43) is now known as killerboy

<iamben> i think so
<[GuS]> bye
<verty_> rypervenche: sure
<ykaeb> Extracting a file to install a system is the easiest thing I've ever
	done to install an OS. What were the stage1 and stage2 installs like?
<iamben> ykaeb: pointless
<rypervenche> I am unable to compile tuxnes http://bpaste.net/show/41563/
									  [03:06]
<iamben> ykaeb: exactly like stage3, but with a "./boostrap.sh" command and
	 "emerge -e system" and a lot of wasted time
<soupeee> I've got 32bit in my use flags but emerge www-plugins/adobe-flash
	  lists -32bit(in blue) in the USE= list. Is this OK?
<verty_> khayyam, a3li: I take it back, there is more at play here, after
	 building ghostscript-gpl without cups, it wants to give it cups again.
	 Ignore what I said before, thank you.
<theadmin> ykaeb: Well, you're not done yet, you still need, at least, a kernel,
	   a bootloader and to set up your make.conf.
<verty_> rypervenche: is it that unz stuff?  [03:07]
<iamben> soupeee: do you plan to use 32bit browsers with flash?
<khayyam> verty_: my sanity is saved! ... np though
<verty_> khayyam: not mine though :)
<soupeee> iamben: well, this is a 32 bit system. But, dunno
<rypervenche> verty_: unz?  [03:08]
<verty_> rypervenche: you are in luck, I have some experience with this.  Let me
	 get my thoughts together and I'll explain
<soupeee> don't I already use 32 bit browsers?
<rypervenche> verty_: Awesome. Thanks.
<theadmin> soupeee: Likely yes, you'll probably just want to emerge
	   www-plugins/adobe-flash or whatit'scalled  [03:09]
<rypervenche> verty_: I also had some issues with another NES emulator, but I
	      was hoping they had something in common. Anyways, one at a
	      time. :)
<soupeee> so USE=32bit is irrelevant?
<khayyam> soupeee: I believe thats only for amd64-multilib  [03:10]
<soupeee> ok, turning it off
<ykaeb> do I need the p option when extracting portage?
<rypervenche> ykaeb: Are you using the guide? Nope, don't need it.  [03:11]
<theadmin> soupeee: That probably won't even be on a 32-bit system, read
	   /usr/portage/profiles/use.desc
<verty_> rypervenche: I'm not sure if tuxnes is the same, but zlib has changed
	 some packages haven't been updated.  That 'OF' stuff is because the gz
	 file routines have changed, there were also changes to the unzip
	 routines, which is what I meant by unz stuff.  Basically, it is out of
	 date and needs to be fixed.  The easiest thing to do is to edit out the
	 gzip code in tuxnes, so it doesn't read zips, which is fine because it
	 isn't needed.  But obvio
<verty_> usly you need to know C to do that.
<verty_> rypervenche: unfortunately, many of those packages don't seem to be
	 maintained anymore, fakenes, etc
<verty_> rypervenche: and I couldn't get fceux to build, which supposedly is the
	 most maintained one  [03:12]
<Vinky> ykaeb, no, it not mentioned in the handbook either if I remember
	correctly
<ykaeb> right
<rypervenche> Ahh, ok. I just wanted to try them all out, since I've never
	      really had the choice. I'll see if I can get another emulator to
	      work then.
<verty_> rypervenche: in my case, I removed the zip stuff from fceu 2.12, an
	 older emulator
<theadmin> ykaeb: No you don't. Actually you don't need to get portage at all,
	   you could've just run "emerge-webrsync"
<theadmin> ykaeb: Well, more of "mkdir /usr/portage && emerge-webrsync", mind
	   you.
<ykaeb> so is portage like the FreeBSD ports system, where you get to tweak
	compilation options and build from source
<soupeee> theadmin: read it off of ufed, you're right
<rypervenche> verty_: Ok, I'll try some others out and will do what you say if I
	      can't get any to work. Thanks.^^  [03:13]
<verty_> rypervenche: it is sad how things have stopped working, not sure what
	 to suggest other than hacking the code
<theadmin> ykaeb: Yep, you get to play with stuff
<ykaeb> this is taking a while :( what was installing gentoo like in the days of
	Pentium 2?  [03:15]
<khayyam> ykaeb: p2 is pre-gentoo
<khayyam> ykaeb: but I've install on 604e ...
<khayyam> ykaeb: powepc 604e that is  [03:16]
<theadmin> Well, I have a friend who attempts a Gentoo install on some i486

<Vinky> rypervenche, the fix seems to be quite simple, the question is what's
	the best way to deploy it
<tdr> theadmin, its possible even though it's not a 686 system, just takes an
      unsupported install method to build it  [03:17]
<benneh> after switching from nouveau to the closed source nvidia drivers, x
	 starts fine, but after ~45 seconds the screen goes black and my laptop
	 becomes completely unresponsive. what could cause a problem like this?
									  [03:18]
<theadmin> tdr: Unsupported? Gentoo has stages and ISOs for 486
<tdr> theadmin, afaik stage3 are 686.
<khayyam> theadmin: and why not ... stage3 is most of what you need for a router
	  or what-have-you
<xvilka> hi! how i can reemerge all installed x11-libs/* ? right now i'm using

<theadmin> khayyam: Well, his is a desktop computer. An old one.
<khayyam> theadmin: buildpkg or tinderbox then

<khayyam> dagerik: don't forget that opening a terminal *also* runs the shell,

	     I am no further help
<spm_Draget> */etc/bashrc
<Amir__> Question: is there a way to connect two VPNs at the same time?
<dagerik> spm_Draget: when you mention it, i recently installed bash auto
	  completion
<spm_Draget> Anyone running kwin with openglES ? with '-opengl gles' useflags it
	     runs a 'kwin' binary anways, while I get a 'kwin_gles' binary,
	     which is not started tho.
<ykaeb> for a hyperthreaded machine like the atom, should I count the new
	threads as cores when writing the MAKEOPTS?
<tdr> Amir__, depending on your setup, yes you can vpn to more than one, but you
      run somewhat of a risk because IP subnets can collide  [03:40]
<spm_Draget> ykaeb: Nah, physical cores is preffered. Like physical cores + 1 -
	     tho if you have little RAM you might even just go fpr 'physical
	     cores * 1'
<spm_Draget> ykaeb: Since swapping makes your compiletimes explode :P
<theadmin> explode = dissapear, sounds good to me.  [03:41]
<Amir__> tdr: i meant connect one vpn inside another
<ykaeb> not good when compiling +4GB packages :(

<Amir__> then i want two connect the second VPN using the first VPN.
<colock> Amir__: i don't see where the problem is  [03:43]
<tdr> Amir__, so your first vpn just becomes your route to the second?
<Amir__> tdr: yes  [03:44]

<spm_Draget> Okay, KDE has .kde4/env/ and some file with KDEWM=xxx to set it to

<theadmin> KDE's not... difficult, it just hides stuff too well.  [03:50]
<theadmin> And then when you find it you feel like an idiot -_-
<colock> Amir__: don't use network-manager for the second one, then  [03:51]
<colock> what kind of vpn software do you use for the second connection?
<spm_Draget> theadmin: Oh, thanks for the tipp. I just read 'kwin_gles
	     --replace' allows replacing kwin right away. But libEGL says
	     GLX/DRI2 is not support and falls back to llvmpipe renderer - bleh.
<spm_Draget> theadmin: Plus, kde does not list any other window manager byside
	     kwin in system settings <.<  [03:52]
<theadmin> spm_Draget: It has an "other" option, it seems, but it's greyed out

<tdr> relentless, its the same way you would do it normally
<tdr> relentless, fdisk isn't destructive, you can just add the partitions and

<nilsatchara> I'm planning to do some Android app development and have decided
	      to try out the Eclipse development environment.  The Android folks
	      require and SDK of 3.6 or greater.  The gentoo repository only has
	      3.5.  So I moved to the seden overlay which has a 3.7 version of
	      the SDK.  It fails after generating about 60K lines of the build
	      log, and it's hard to figure out why it failed.  Here's the last
	      1000 lines of the build log: http://bpaste.net/show/41582/

<neodragon> khayyam: thats what I figured, but it gets even better, I just went

	    bug, and noticed another bug already filed. Log story short, his
	    response to the other bug is that he is no longer maintaining any
	    compiz-fusion ebuild and that he has since moved on to working on
	    Gnome3 and that any fixes will have to be created by the user
									  [04:55]
<khayyam> neodragon: I see, in which case you can rebuild the checksum with the
	  following (assuming the source tarball is good): ebuild
	  /path/to/overlay/<category>/<package>/<package>-<version> manifest
									  [04:57]
<nilsatchara> ambro718: Thanks, I'll try that.  [04:58]
<ambro718> nilsatchara: unlike most precompiled (or is it just Java?) software,
	   Eclipse should run file from your home folder after you extract it
									  [05:00]
<nilsatchara> khayyam: It was probably me.  I couldn't find an error either.  As
	      suggested by ambro718, I'm going to try using the eclipse tarballs
	      instead.
<ambro718> * fine
<khayyam> neodragon: but your taking somewhat of a risk with an unsupported
	  package as there will be no upgrade path
<khayyam> nilsatchara: ahhh! there you are, well, the only error I can see is
	  Bundle org.apache.lucene not found  [05:01]
<neodragon> khayyam: thanks that seems to have worked, I do beleive the source

<ykaeb> compiling the kernel seems difficult :( how do I ensure I don't end up
	with a system that doesn't boot, and that I end up with a system that
	has all the driver it needs?
<khayyam> neodragon: sorry, speaking to the wrong nick :P
<akarin> ykaeb: make multiple grub entries, so if you can't boot into your new
	 kernel, you can just boot from your backup  [05:05]
<khayyam> ykaeb: your insurance is in the fact that you can boot the bootdisk
	  and fix it if you make a mistake, otherwise, there is lspci to check
	  hardware against kernel options
<ykaeb> right  [05:06]
<khayyam> ykaeb: or you take the genkernel route
<neodragon> khayyam: that is part of the reason I am trying to learn this stuff
	    because I want to eventually become the official maintainer. The
	    other reason is I am going to college for software engineering and I
	    want to learn the linux/open source way to develop software rather
	    then the Windows way of developing software.  [05:07]
<ambro718> neodragon: "linux" and "windows" are not ways of developing software
									  [05:08]
<khayyam> neodragon: I seem to remember someone discussion in this very channel
	  yesterday stating that compiz was being abandoned (but don't quote me)
									  [05:09]
<neodragon> what I mean is using tools other then Visual Studio and the like
<ambro718> neodragon: using Visual Studio is equally bad as using an Autotools
	   build system  [05:10]
<khayyam> neodragon: s/someone/some
<ambro718> both will be default limit you to a certain platform
<ambro718> CMake is nice if you want cross-platform (and otherwise too)  [05:11]
<ykaeb> I use autotools :(  [05:12]
<Vinky> ambro718, off-topic but autotools works on windows too
<ambro718> Vinky: it might, after you install a complete linux compatibility
	   layer  [05:13]
<ambro718> and it's dead slow
<neodragon> khayyam: no compiz-fusion isn't dead, the original developers seem
	    to have stopped working on it, but now Ubuntu has pretty much taken
	    over the project as Unity needs compiz-fusion to function
<khayyam> neodragon: I see .. well, that was the jist of the discussion, I
	  wasn't paying much attention  [05:14]
<neodragon> essentially Unity in just a BIG compiz-fuson plugin
<ambro718> Vinky: and I wouldn't dare try to get autotools compile with cl.exe
<Vinky> ambro718, anyway OT  [05:15]
<neodragon> khayyam: so of course Canonical is going to maintain compiz-fusion
	    since you can't have to full Unity experience without it
									  [05:16]
<solidus-river> hmm, i cleaned up my world file as well  [05:17]
<solidus-river> nothing too bad in there
<neodragon> khayyam: it looks like from the compiz.org website that the last
	    release that the original developers did was 0.8.8 so every version
	    from 0.9.0 up has been from canonical  [05:18]
<solidus-river> i should clean up my use flags as well but somethign tells me
		while emerge is failing at maintaining my system, i shouldn't
		fuck wtih use vars
<neodragon> khayyam: so if Canonical/Ubuntu are now maintaining/developing
	    Compiz-fusion, which means it is not a dead project, why can't we
	    have it officially supported in gentoo?  [05:19]
<neodragon> or is it just that no one wants to step up and maintain the packages
	    for the gentoo repos  [05:20]
<ambro718> neodragon: I would expect that they only maintain the parts they need
	   for Unity
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v floppym
<khayyam> neodragon: to answer that I'd have to look into the
	  builds/dependencies/etc ... but generally, its a matter of manpower
									  [05:21]
<neodragon> ambro718: thats just it, I have heard Ubuntu users in my LUG talk
	    about the fact that Ubuntu is slowly adding back in a lot of the
	    compiz-fusion functionallity with each release, as they work out the
	    kinks with Unity  [05:22]
<khayyam> neodragon: also, its not something that just happens there has to be
	  some sort of drive behind it, its not like gentoo users are all
	  swooning for Unity  [05:23]
<q0_0p> I'm liking gnome2  with compiz
<neodragon> eventually they hope to have the full compiz-fusion effects working
	    side by side with Unity
<neodragon> I didn't say I wanted Unity, it is still possible even on other
	    distros to use compiz-fusion without Unity  [05:24]
<ykaeb> what process scheduler do you guys recommend?
<ykaeb> for a netbook
<khayyam> ykaeb: ondemand would be best for a laptop  [05:25]
<neodragon> khayyam: what I want is a standalone compiz/emerald DE on gentoo
<khayyam> neodragon: ok, but me, personally, I have absolutely no interest in
	  any of the DE out there .. so I'm not going to be pushing that compiz
	  get included, thats what I ment about 'drive'  [05:26]
<neodragon> khayyam: what DE/WM do you use then  [05:27]
<khayyam> neodragon: on my main computer i use i3 and on my netbook ratpoison
									  [05:28]
<neodragon> I see, very minimal
<neodragon> khayyam: I don't like ratpoison, it's a bit too minimalistic for me

<khayyam> Stylee: probably 'emerge x11-base/xorg-server

<Stylee> khayyam: the problem is, that it pulls x11-base/xorg-server-1.12.3

<Stylee> I want to have x11-base/xorg-server-1.12.99.904  [05:43]
<khayyam> Stylee: ok .. in which case its a dependency of that particular
	  version of nvidia-drivers  [05:44]
<Stylee> khayyam: I see  [05:45]
<Stylee> khayyam: so I need an ebuild that knows that there is a new version of
	 xorg and that is actually the one that nvidia needs?  [05:46]
<khayyam> Stylee: wait you a version installed which is ~arch  [05:48]
<khayyam> Stylee: and so if your running ~arch then you probably have the ~arch
	  nvidia-drivers  [05:49]
<khayyam> Stylee: so it looks like your downgrading xorg-server to stable
									  [05:50]
<Stylee> khayyam: it actually doesn't let me have the lastest 12.99.904  [05:52]
<Stylee> doesn't matter, thank you anyway  [05:53]

<coin3d> maybe you should genkernel give a try
<lordcirth> ykaeb: What I do is install with genkernel, then edit grub to have a

	    50% packet loss to my "router" or into the inet
<lordcirth> I don't have problems. 3.2Ghz X6, gets stuff done
<PSYKORGASM> Unless you know what you are doing though ykaeb, use gen and just
	     deal with the long compile so you have osmething working.

<khayyam> ykaeb: or: http://www.kernel-seeds.org/  [06:30]

<BlackCore> or just everything you need?
<A-medic> Speaking of kernels, I think I want to go the apparmor route just

<Phr33d0m> A-medic all kernels come with selinux and apparmor you just have to
	   choose it in the kernel config  [06:34]

<khayyam> A-medic: for any number of reasons

<Kwarkje> how to check , @ set files, where they are located?
<blaise> I'm really content with rxvt-unicode
<BlackCore> damn, genius name for a terminal emulator
<lordcirth> BlackCore: I know eh? Its an awesome program too

<blaise> uhrm.. not sure what exactly you're refering to..
<khayyam> blaise: actually, I think its called mark-yank-urls now
<khayyam> blaise: urxvt supports modules (written in perl)
<blaise> yeah, I've not looked into that yet  [06:59]
<khayyam> blaise: mark-yank-urls will make urls yankable
<blaise> what is yankable?
<khayyam> blaise: they can be pased to the the pastebuffer or passed to a
	  browser  [07:00]
<khayyam> blaise: 'yanked' in the vim sense  [07:01]
<blaise> khayyam: I just use the normal method..
<khayyam> eg: URxvt.keysym.M-u: perl:mark-yank-urls:activate_mark_mode  [07:02]
<khayyam> blaise: so meta-u gets you into yank mode and then you define further

<rypervenche> tzorvas: emerge -qpv packagename
<rypervenche> oh
<rypervenche> Sorry, misread that.  [07:28]
<tzorvas> rypervenche: hm seems that quse -D "flag" | grep "package", did the
	  job
<tzorvas> rypervenche: but is there any other solution for this?
<rypervenche> tzorvas: It's in /usr/portage/profiles/use.desc.local
<enleth> Hi there. I'm installing gentoo on a Celeron 220 machine and I'm quite
	 confused by the
	 http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Safe_Cflags/Intel#Intel_Core_Solo.2FDuo.2C_Pentium_Dual-Core_T20xx.2FT21xx
	 page - it suggests that my Celeron is Pentium-M based and doesn't
	 provide a 64bit preset, even though there's a 64bit system running on
	 it right now.
<enleth> Should I combine march=prescott with amd64-pc-linux-gnu?  [07:30]
<enleth> This looks like calling for problems.
<tzorvas> rypervenche: not very satisfied from this. bitlbee for example, has
	  only 4 records inside local.desc :$  [07:31]
<tzorvas> rypervenche: quse -D | grep -E "global|package", seems to do the job
	  better :P
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v TitanOfOld
<rypervenche> They don't always have them, unfortunately.
<rypervenche> Hmmm.
<rypervenche> I have yet to try that out.  [07:32]
<iamben> enleth: if you aren't using distcc, just use -march=native  [07:33]
<enleth> iamben: heh, nice trick, thanks.
<tzorvas> rypervenche: next step is to find something that will explain all the
	  use flags of a specific package
<iamben> tzorvas: equery u pkgname  [07:34]
<enleth> Anyway, that page in gentoo docs seems to have confused Celeron 220
	 with something older.
<iamben> enleth: that page is old and incorrect in many places
<enleth> 220 is based on Conroe-L, Core microarchitecture.
<tzorvas> iamben: awesome thanks :)
<iamben> i always just look up a cpu on wikipedia to see exactly which microarch
	 it's from
<rypervenche> iamben: ooooooo, awesome!  [07:35]
<tzorvas> next step is to find a way to clean my gentoo from un-needed files
	  inside distfiles, non needed docs, configs etc  [07:36]
<iamben> tzorvas: "eclean-dist -d" for the distfiles, "qfile -o /path/to/file"
	 to see if a file is orphaned  [07:37]
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v dol-sen
<bg> hello  [07:38]
<tzorvas> iamben: yes, just looked at manpage of eclean and i will give a try
	  for this `eclean-dist -d -t1m -s50M -f`
<TomWij> Any idea why eix-diff gives me a diff between previous-previous and
	 previous and not between previous and current portage tree?
									  [07:40]
<TomWij> (Upon doing an eix-sync)
<khayyam> tzorvas: you can use INSTALL_MASK in conjunction with /etc/portage/env
	  to define docs/files/etc that shouldn't be installed to the filesystm
<rypervenche> If a compile fails or if I ctrl+C an emerge, where would those
	      files stay? What would be the best way to remove those files too?
	      (eclean?)  [07:44]
<iamben> rypervenche: /var/tmp/portage, the best way to clean it is just "rm -r
	 /var/tmp/portage/*" while emerge is not running
<solidus-river> where can i find my init logs?  [07:45]
<rypervenche> Thanks.^^
<solidus-river> also, is there any reason to have both jre and jdk installed?
<iamben> solidus-river: you will need to enable rc logging in /etc/rc.conf, then
	 the default location is /var/log/rc.log
<solidus-river> i'm getting a warning but it clears the console after boot,
		annoying behavoir  [07:46]
<rypervenche> iamben: Ah, looks like it gets deleted automatically too. :)
<iamben> rypervenche: by default, they are deleted after a successful build but
	 remain after a failed build.  you can tweak this behavior with some
	 FEATURES options though  [07:47]
<tzorvas> khayyam: well, nice suggestion, but for now i am looking on how to
	  detect files that are irrelevant with my setup. (files from unmerged
	  packages etc)  [07:48]
<rypervenche> iamben: I've never set that, but some of my failed packages are
	      not there, only two that are recent.
<khayyam> tzorvas: oh ok, in which case: equery belongs /path/to/file may help
	  (at least for orphen files)  [07:49]
<iamben> rypervenche: the same dir is used for a given package-version, no
	 matter how many times you do it... so if you last attempt DID succeed,
	 then the old failures will not be there anymore
<iamben> tzorvas: that's what qfile -o does
<tzorvas> i am always getting this error "ERROR:
	  gnome-extra/avant-window-navigator-extras-9999-r1 failed (depend
	  phase)" in emerge and now in eclean. should i just remove this package
	  (whole folder) from tree?
<tzorvas> it's not in tree, but in flora overlay  [07:50]
<tzorvas> and i am never trying to build it. it just appears in every sync /
	  emerge / unmerge / eclean. without affecting the last result of any of
	  these actions... all running fine just a bunch of lines got displayed
	  showing that it failed to "build" this package  [07:51]
<TomWij> tzorvas: Why did the depend phase failed? Can you upload the log.
									  [07:52]
<tzorvas> TomWij: ok one min  [07:53]
<solidus-river> hmm, how do i tell what packages depend on jre and which depend
		on jdk, is emerge smart enough to know if i have a jdk installed
		i dont need a jre  [07:54]
<tzorvas> http://bpaste.net/show/9oGjngK5NxqhxIDENIut/ this is the log from
	  eclean latest action. after the last line it shows every other file
	  that it deleted etc.. no other info/warning/error under this line
<tzorvas> TomWij: ^
<TomWij> tzorvas: API of python.eclass in EAPI="4-python" not established
									  [07:55]
<tzorvas> TomWij: so its a fault inside package and nothing to do here?  [07:57]
<TomWij> I think so.
<tzorvas> :)
<TomWij> Sounds like something high-end that's not implemented yet, you're using
	 -9999 so you can't expect anything else. :D  [07:58]
<lordcirth> I can't get SLiM to run openbox-session.
<tzorvas> TomWij: nop i am not using this package :$ it's just in flora overlay

<litwol> hrm. i wonder what i'm doing wrong. i've destroyed raid1 array which
	 handled my /boot, i've zero-superblock the partition on drives which
	 had the raid, then i ran grub2-install on one of the drives, and now i
	 get error disk 'mduuid/....'  not found  [08:02]
<proof> hey guys
<proof> sup
<litwol> i wonder if i need to install grub on all the drives, just in case
<litwol> oooo
<litwol> maybe my boot order is wrong  [08:03]

<litwol> yeah probably trying to hit up other disk first which still has mdadm
	 info
* litwol verifies
<tzorvas> litwol: paranoia
<litwol> neh. anti paranoia  [08:04]
<litwol> i had raid5 fail on me (didnt lose anything cause it was fresh install)
<litwol> so now i'm installing on single drive like the old days
<litwol> 2tb disks will be enough for a while
<litwol> and i'll keep raid1 2tb as unmounted backup location  [08:05]
<tzorvas> does anyone use bitlbee? can you verify that it cant build with skype

<blueness> let me see why its masksed
<tzorvas>   [3]   default/linux/amd64/10.0/desktop *  [08:10]
<litwol> yey. yeah installing grub on all 3 disks (to avoid logging into bios to
	 control order) did the trick
<blueness>   22 Mar 2012; Tim Harder <radhermit@gentoo.org> package.use.mask:
<blueness>   Mask USE="skype" for bitlbee since skype has no stable versions.
<blueness> tzorvas, there you go
<tzorvas> ok thanks :(
<blueness> so radhermit wanted to stabilized bitlbee and since skype (a dep)
	   won't ever go stable, he masked it  [08:11]
<blueness> tzorvas, you can unmask it yourself
<blueness> tzorvas, man 5 portage  [08:12]
<blueness> look at package.use.mask
<tzorvas> echo "-skype" >> /etc/portage/profile/use.mask did the job :)  [08:14]
<ykaeb> how do I 'unemerge' a package?
<tzorvas> but i will go with per package unmasking of useflags, its better :D
<solidus-river> man, why does cups require jre :(  [08:15]
<tzorvas> ykaeb: emerge -C "package"
<iamben> solidus-river: well, it's got a java USE flag  [08:17]
<solidus-river> ah, that was my next step... clean up my use flags
<solidus-river> it looks like cups is the only thing requiring a jre on my
		system
<tzorvas> blueness: sorry for disturbing you again, but is there any specific
	  reason that you are not using bitlbee lately? switched to another
	  (better) solution? or just using again the defauilt "apps"?
									  [08:18]
<ykaeb> is sys-boot/grub actually grub2?  [08:19]
<tzorvas> ykaeb: if you have installed sys-boot/grub-2.00 then yes :)  [08:20]
<solidus-river> ykaeb: it is if you use the second slot
<tzorvas> i have to say that i hate grub2..  [08:21]
<solidus-river> can someone point me to a good grub -> grub2 upgrade guide?
<solidus-river> i dont understand why they changed all the config syntax etc
<tzorvas> solidus-river: if you find any solid, please pass it to me too :$
<tzorvas> confix syntax in grub2, is aweful  [08:22]
<solidus-river> tzorvas: why do you want to upgrade? chances are its not worth
		it imo
<iamben> solidus-river: http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GRUB2_Quick_Start
<solidus-river> tzorvas: oh, your not the one looking to upgrade :P
<tzorvas> solidus-river: :P
<blueness> tzorvas, no specific reason
<iamben> it's a good walkthrough from start to finish, but the end of the guide
	 also shows a quick example of how to convert grub1 to grub2 config
	 syntax  [08:23]
<blueness> i was using it for an interface between aol aim and my xchat client
<blueness> but i just started using pidgin
<blueness> nothing deep
<tzorvas> blueness: ah fine :)

	 "unable to find root block device in .". any ideas?  [09:09]

<StrayLite> CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG=y
<StrayLite> # CONFIG_MMC is not set
<StrayLite> I take it there is my problem?  [09:10]
<mkdesu> StrayLite, yes, enable MMC_BLOCK
<johnnyquest> iamben: only showing 4.1.18 in portage. Is it coming soon? I can
	      do without it long as I member to fix it latter.
<StrayLite> # CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN is not set
<iamben> johnnyquest: it's about 2 days old in portage  [09:11]
<Guest69058> wassup with this: http://bpaste.net/show/1NDyTNZBTnGr41uNX2Uv/
<mkdesu> MULTI_LUN is not necessary, it's some obscure SCSI thing
<ghs> proof
<johnnyquest> resyncing then
<StrayLite> Where is MMC in menuconfig?
<mkdesu> StrayLite, somewhere in devices, look at its relative location in
	 .config  [09:12]
<iamben> StrayLite: hit "/" to search menuconfig.  but i stand by my advice of
	 enabling multi-lun
<mkdesu> iamben, MULTI_LUN is irrelevant, I have it disabled  [09:13]
<iamben> i respectfully disagree
<StrayLite> hmm  [09:14]
<annihilator> CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND:         is not set when it should be.  what
	      does that mean?
<StrayLite> Must be in the "Probe all LUNs for SCSI Device"
<mkdesu> iamben, it doesn't matter whether you agree, I state facts
<StrayLite> "Probe all LUNs on each SCSI Device"
<l15156> trying to install Gentoo from an USB Key and I'm getting "unable to

<l15156> the usb key partition is /dev/sdb1, i enter that and it says wrong root

<StrayLite> MMC/SD/SDIO
<mkdesu> yes
<StrayLite> You are probably both right, though

<khayyam> annihilator: enable/disable autosuspend for usb devices support in the
	  kernel, so whatever is proving that error probably requires it enabled
									  [09:17]
<nawks> multi lun is necessary
<iamben> both the internal storage, and the removable card-reader, are one "LUN"
	 on the single scsi device
<annihilator> ok thanks khayyam
<iamben> this is why you need multi-lun support.  MMC support is for a
	 card-reader on a laptop, for example.  for a single usb-plugged phone
	 or media player, this is a multi-lun issue
<johnnyquest> 115156 gentoo dosnt install its configures, you should be booting
	      http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml after using something like
	      unetbootin then unpack the stage3 to the hard drive in the proper
	      location
<crazy_yeti> there's a bug for this in arch, but not gentoo:
	     https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/28574  [09:19]
<crazy_yeti> i guess i'll file a bug
<ghs> iamben, My gentoo not recognize cd/dvd, only cd/dvd blank.  [09:20]
<StrayLite> Well
<StrayLite> I built both
<StrayLite> If it works then I can always test it wothout the multi-lun and see
	    what happens
<StrayLite> Time to boot my new kernel  [09:21]
<annihilator> khayyam: where is that feature at in the kernel i cant find it
									  [09:23]
<khayyam> crazy_yeti: I don't see why it even needs a path, its either in the
	  users $PATH or not, and the completion system should be configurable
	  to no load completions for non-existant commands  [09:24]
<khayyam> annihilator: under Device Drivers => USB => thingyumps
<khayyam> annihilator: CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND .. so "/" and search  [09:25]
<StrayLite> THe kernel tweak worked... now I will recompile without the
	    multi_lun and see if it still works. That will settle it. :-)
									  [09:28]
<khayyam> StrayLite: why not look at dmesg ... you should see multi-lun if its
	  active  [09:29]
<StrayLite> khayyam: I know it's active.  [09:30]
<StrayLite> The question is whether it was needed for accessing the MicroSD card
	    on my mp3 player or not
<annihilator> thank u so much khayyam  [09:31]
<khayyam> annihilator: np
<khayyam> StrayLite: well, you should see the 'lun' registered if and when you
	  connect the SD  [09:32]
<crazy_yeti> khayyam:  i agree about hard-coded paths.  i see this all the time
	     in shell scripts, its a style i don't agree with
<StrayLite> ahh
<crazy_yeti> khayyam:  i don't know how many times I've seen people do stuff
	     like /bin/ls in shell scripts, etc.  like they are worried about a
	     malicious "ls" inserted somewhere in the users $PATH?  [09:33]
<StrayLite> Getting ready to reboot without the multi_lun for a test
<jarray52> How long does glibc take to build?
<crazy_yeti> khayyam:  i'm not one of those types who is super-paranoid about
	     security, though ....
<iamben> jarray52: 5-500 minutes usually
<crazy_yeti> jarray:  that would depend on your system :-)
<khayyam> crazy_yeti: in zsh you can do the following: zstyle
	  ':completion:*:functions' ignored-patterns '_*' .. so no completions
	  are loaded that are not in the array ${commands[]}
<ghs> My gentoo/gnome not recognize  cd/dvd, only,  cd/dvd blank. Because ?
									  [09:34]
<crazy_yeti> khayyam:  yeah, zsh  users are always telling me why their shell is
	     better :-)    but i ain't switchin', at least, not today .....
<jarray52> iamben: With 16 processors, should it take more than 5 hours?
<iamben> jarray52: what do you think? =)  [09:35]
<crazy_yeti> jarray:  are you using '-j 20' (or something like that) in
	     /etc/make.conf?
<khayyam> crazy_yeti: I did say 'better' :) ... its purely comparison
<jarray52> iamben: yes...
<jarray52> iamben: been waiting...
<crazy_yeti> khayyam:  it probably is better :-)   i just know bash too well
<crazy_yeti> khayyam:  one of these days, i'll switch to zsh, right after I
	     teach myself Haskell :-)  [09:36]
<iamben> it will probably take around 5 minutes with 16 cores, with sufficient
	 RAM available and enough jobs
<khayyam> crazy_yeti: well, you wouldn't notice :)
<ghs> I copy kernel for arch/x86_66/boot .. or arch/x86/boot ... ?
<crazy_yeti> jarry:  doing a parallel  build?
<StrayLite> DOes not work without multi_lun
<ghs> x86_64
<nawks> StrayLite: yup, now you can fix that and take out mmc (if you are not on
	a notebook)
<nawks> and we can say MKDESUDESUDESU  [09:37]
<crazy_yeti> ghs:  if i understand you, you are saying that  nautilus recognizes
	     a blank disk, but not one with files on it?
<ghs> crashmag, yes.
<ghs> oops
<crazy_yeti> ghs:  what filesystem is the disk formatted with?
<khayyam> crazy_yeti: I mean if you switched that is
<ghs> crazy_yeti, yes.
<annihilator> thank you soo much khayyam it took a little while and a few
	      dependency checks but i did find it LOL  [09:38]
<crazy_yeti> ghs:  sounds like you do not have support in your kernel for
	     whatever fs is on that media, perhaps
<khayyam> annihilator: again, np
<ghs> crazy_yeti, I already compile udf in my kernel, but, not it worked!
<crazy_yeti> ghs: sorry, what didn't work? building udf?  [09:39]
<crazy_yeti> ghs:  what's in /proc/filesystems?
<jarray52> iamben: Is there anything in the glibc-2.15-r2 build that would cause
	   a loop? It does some stuff, then prints: done >
	   /var/tmp/portage/sys-libs/glibc-2.15-r2/work/build-x86-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-nptl/sysd-syscallsT
<StrayLite> So mmc is not necessary, nawks?
<StrayLite> That is not support for MicroSD?  [09:40]
<jarray52> iamben: I've been seeing that line for quite some time now.
<ghs> crazy_yeti, http://bpaste.net/show/41612/
<nawks> StrayLite: it is support for non-usb connected sd hardware
<StrayLite> ahh  [09:41]

<ghs> iamben, it worked! with mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom

<ghs> iamben,  /dev/sr0: LABEL="JavaHTP6e" TYPE="iso9660"  [10:03]
<InferiorHuman> iamben, if I shrink the partition to say 50 gb to be safe since

	  with that one file? Right now it isn't purging the files until all the
	  files are done.  [10:39]
<khayyam> cdnl: pre-welcome to gentoo ... don't forget forums.getoo.org
<khayyam> cdnl: forums.gentoo.org ... correction  [10:40]
<solidus-river> Flikker: doesnt look like it from the man page  [10:41]
<solidus-river> you could write a script to move then delete each file
		individually
<khayyam> Flikker: with a loop ... probabaly
<solidus-river> are you running into space issues?
<solidus-river> because that would be significantly slower
<solidus-river> Flikker: and if you think about it, this isn't want the average
		use case wants. if mv fails mid move, you dont want to be left
		with half the files one place and half the other
									  [10:42]
<Flikker> solidus-river: I didn't see one their either (man page). No... not
	  space issues... I'm moving DVD ISOs from one drive to another bigger
	  drive and it has locked up on me twice forcing a reboot.
<Flikker> solidus-river: Absolutely. BUT an option would be nice. :)
<khayyam> Flikker: that sounds more like a driver/HW issue than
	  resources/software  [10:43]
<exile777> yeah, better check them md5's before you delete the source files
									  [10:44]
<iamben> Flikker: maybe just script it?
<Flikker> khayyam: I don't really trust the source drive... part of why I'm
	  moving stuff off and I'm sure it doesn't help that I'm moving 4gb to
	  8gb images around (I plan to "unzip" them later)
<iamben> for i in *; do mv $i destdir; done
<Flikker> iamben: you know... you guys make it seem so easy... ;)
<exile777> i know right, lol need to read a book about bash. they always tell me
	   to make a bash script and im like ffffffffff  [10:45]
<exile777> and its always like one line
<Flikker> exile777: I'm getting to the dangerous point... I was assuming I'd
	  have to do something with find and xargs and I wasn't seeing what I
	  liked on google... etc...

<zjhui1> It's the ebuild's problem ?
<Wasmosy> nawks: nope
<nawks> Flikker: i got through that by setting the drive's readahead to 1 using
	hdparm/sdparm  [10:54]
<nawks> there are a couple settings related to that

<nawks> the drive was crashing because of too much error correction load with

<johnnyquest> iamben: somethings off here on this vbox updates. its complaining
	      about the vboxpci module. There is another way to load and view
	      modules on the system or to pull modules in to be updated via
	      modules-update outside of using the conf.d/modules config or
	      eselect. But I dont remember what it was I may of messed that up
	      last time. what is it?  [11:01]
<Wasmosy> In short: your device doesn't use MTP as libmtp understands it. It's a
	  custom stack by Samsung and you're sort of just screwed... lovely
									  [11:03]
<iamben> johnnyquest: how is it complaining?
<johnnyquest> exact same as before vboxpci.co does not exist  [11:04]
<johnnyquest> .ko*
<nawks> other people have galaxy working
<Wasmosy> gonna try rebooting  [11:05]
<Wasmosy> brb
<iamben> johnnyquest: but lib/modules/$(uname -r)/misc/vboxpci.ko does exist?
									  [11:06]
<johnnyquest> no it never has my system never used it till all sudden, but I
	      know others did have it  [11:07]
<Sloloem> So, I export PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and set it to a directory that has
	  libavcodec.pc, for a cross compilation.  Then I try to run the
	  pkg-config for that crossdev to find the library, and it fails telling
	  me to add the directory that's already in PKG_CONFIG_PATH to
	  PKG_CONFIG_PATH.  Am I misunderstanding something?  Does the crossdev
	  toolchain have its own version of the environment variable?
									  [11:09]
<iamben> johnnyquest: what command is giving the error about vboxpci?
<johnnyquest> iamben: during emerge, and just pulling in virtualbox it pulls in
	      the modules first anyways. http://pastebin.com/7TwuD1E1
									  [11:11]
<Sloloem> Oh.  the pkg-config is a shell script that unsets the variable.  Is
	  there some way to feed it a path anyway, if someone is immediately
	  familiar with it?  [11:17]
<iamben> johnnyquest: oh i thought this was a module LOAD problem, it seems to
	 be a build problem.  can you pastebin the full build.log?
<johnnyquest> iamben: http://bpaste.net/show/41618/  [11:18]
<iamben> maybe even 4.1.20 doesn't build on 3.6_rc yet  [11:21]
<johnnyquest> well I was using it on R1
<johnnyquest> without the vboxpci.ko possibly kernel changes is causing it to
	      pull in, except that it is not pulling in very kindly  [11:22]

<violetina> kexwork: native ia almost always fine ;) except if you need distcc

	       potentially any os. check out the pGentoo prefix project. Gentoo
	       FreeBSD, Gentoo OpenBSD, Gentoo Dragonfly BSD and Gentoo NetBSD

<alexander__b> kexwork: Gentoo FreeBSD is the most working/documented one
	       AFAIK. I'll be working on Gentoo MINIX this Autumn myself. :-)
<kexwork> one thing I wondered about, one of my machines at work is running
	  Ubuntu(ugh, I know), and printing etc works 'out of the box' with our
	  network printers, how hard would it be for one to acheieve the same
	  functionality with Gentoo? I am looking to use only Gentoo for my work
	  machines.  [18:19]
<kexwork> alexander__b: that sounds like an awesome project, any more info, how
	  could one get involved? :)  [18:20]
<alexander__b> kexwork: network printers are iffy. but if it works in Ubuntu, it
	       should work fine in Gentoo. try asking on the forum with the
	       specific printer stuff. do you use CUPS in Ubuntu?
<nachos> Hi, with parted how can I change a filesystem type of a partition?
									  [18:21]
<corentin> kexwork: you just need cups and the right driver for your printer
<kexwork> I beleive so, it's just the default 'printers' service that comes with
	  LTS (Which i beleive is CUPS)
<alexander__b> kexwork: well you follow the Gentoo FreeBSD install guide and use
	       MINIX instead of FreeBSD. then you pray it doesn't break. then it
	       breaks. then you ask if someone else has fixed it. then, when
	       they of course haven't, you fix it. pretty straightforward. :-)
<alexander__b> kexwork: then you just need CUPS with the right driver, as
	       corentin says. should be easy. :-)
<kexwork> sweet :)

<alexander__b> nachos: uhm parted is what everyone use
<kexwork> ah nice :)
<alexander__b> nachos: windows users boot linux live CDs to use parted
<corentin> nachos: then you just need to apply the new filesystem type you want
<nachos> first of all, using GUI's just makes the situation worse  [18:24]
<alexander__b> nachos: just mkfs
<corentin> nachos: basically just prepare your partitions and setup the right fs
	   with fdisk, then apply the filesystem to the partitions
<nachos> second, just because everyone else uses it doesnt mean i should

<dagb> hi. eix claims I have 249 packages in 156 categories, after a regular
       eix-sync  [21:16]
<dagb> is a there a memo I did not get?  [21:17]

<TitanOfOld> dagb: Yes. It looks like we're finally decomposing. We kept pretty
	     well considering we died 5 years ago.  [21:19]
<dagb> TitanOfOld: :-)
<kexwork> anyone know why I would be missing the symlink 'linux' pointing to the
	  kernel source during install procedure?  [21:20]
<dagb> TitanOfOld: but seriously. any idea? Looks like the actual sync works
       ok. emerge -pv foo finds foo. eix does not, obviously.  [21:21]
<SkunkyFone> kexwork: because you didn't make it
<kexwork> '  [21:22]
<kexwork> When you take a look in /usr/src you should see a symlink called linux
	  pointing to your kernel source'
<Tucos> eselect should make that one, iirc
<kexwork> I didn't read anything saying to create it
<dagb> eix finds a handful of packages, but it looks as if the packages it finds
       are only very 'core' packages.

<DarkCircle> jauhien / you may use -p option :)
<jauhien> hmmm
<jauhien> in ebuild?
<jauhien> then I will need to parse it
<YoungFrog> so you're writing an ebuild and want to know which version of
	    somepackage is installed ? The question is : why would you need that
	    information ?
<jauhien> I'm writing ebuild and SRC_URI needed for test flag depends on the

<jauhien> my package depends on lhapdf and for testing it needs some tarballs

<YoungFrog> I see. And cannot help,sorry.
<jauhien> eicher: equery? hmm, I can not see the necessary command. Command that
	  gets version  [22:59]
<jauhien> so, there is no standard way?  [23:00]
<jauhien> So, I just will parse emerge output. Thanks to all, who have answered

<lordcirth> I unmerged openssl.... How can I fix it?  [23:03]
<keven> on using locate it shows error locate: can not stat ()

	do
<theadmin> keven: Run update-db I guess  [23:04]
<keven> theadmin: it says command not found  [23:05]
<theadmin> keven: Sorry, no -. So "updatedb"
<keven> theadmin: its doing something lets see  [23:06]
<eicher> lordcirth: remerge openssl ?
<keven> theadmin: thanx it worked  [23:07]
<lordcirth> eicher: But openssl is required to merge, that's the problem
<theadmin> keven: There we go... locate is an index-based program so you gotta
	   generate the index first
<eicher> lordcirth: so portage wants openssl installed ?  [23:08]
<theadmin> Can someone explain what's the deal with the latest amd64 ghc being
	   6.12.3-r2? Old much >.<  [23:09]
<lordcirth> eicher: Yes, any merge fails with "wget: error while loading shared
	    libraries: libssl.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such
	    file or directory"
<megaTherion> lordcirth: your wget is broken... repair it first
<theadmin> lordcirth: Try using a different FETCHCOMMAND (man make.conf)  [23:10]
<nawks> you could build wget without gnutls and ssl as a temp fix
<lordcirth> theadmin: What command should I use?
<nawks> lordcirth: but you should still have an openssl distfile in your system,
	so why can't you rebuilt openssl?  [23:11]
<lordcirth> nawks: I thought so too but it won't let me
<eicher> nawks: same idea here, try emerge wget without gntls
<theadmin> lordcirth: I duno, you can try curl or whatever downloader you have
	   installed. At worst, write a script which echoes the URI it's given
	   and fails (returns 1), then download the file from that URI manually.
<eicher> lordcirth: or you download the file with firefox or some other browser
	 and put it in to the portage/packages folder  [23:12]
<eicher> so you can remerge opensll

<lordcirth> wget: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.0.0: cannot

<theadmin> lordcirth: This appears to be the latest unmasked openssl in Gentoo:

	   /usr/portage/distfiles and you may be good to go
<lordcirth> theadmin: yes its DLing now  [23:15]
<lordcirth> theadmin: It still fails, its trying to download a hash/checksum

<lordcirth> !!! Couldn't download 'openssl-c_rehash.sh.1.7'. Aborting.  [23:18]
<YoungFrog> jauhien: from the reading of =man portage=, it seems that the

	    wanted
<lordcirth> theadmin: I got it manually, should it go in the same dir?  [23:19]
<theadmin> lordcirth: Yes

<lordcirth> theadmin: Ya. I was doing an update and openssl failed to update bc
	    it conflicts with "bindist". I reflexively removed it, then realized
	    that was a bad idea

<jauhien> YoungFrog: thanks, but I will use best_version. It seems it's that I
	  need  [23:25]
<theadmin> lordcirth: Not entirely sure what bindist is but still, you can't
	   "reflexively" type something like "emerge --unmerge openssl", can you
<lordcirth> theadmin: bindist removes all patent-encumbered code. I'm running a
	    completely libre system, and I kind of attack any program that
	    sneaks thru  [23:28]
<theadmin> lordcirth: Oh...
* theadmin looks at the amount of closed-source and weird-ass software installed
  here and shrugs
<reisio> well, it removes things included in provided binaries  [23:29]
<reisio> I'm not sure that flag is appropriate as used on openssl :p but
	 whatever
<lordcirth> theadmin: Its a USE flag, like "deblob"  [23:30]
<theadmin> lordcirth: I know, I read my use.desc.
<theadmin> That wasn't long ago either
<lordcirth> reisio: I was told it was for patents. Perhaps I was told wrong. But
	    it doesn't seem to conflict anymore, so, whatever  [23:31]
<reisio> the description for openssl is that it's for patented stuff
<reisio> but there's plenty of patented stuff in portage
<reisio> the true purpose of the flag in my understanding is to exclude things
	 ordinarily found only in binaries distributed by upstream, like
	 intellectual property (like branding)  [23:32]
<khayyam> with openssl I think bindist just removes support for 'idea' and
	  'mdc2'
* reisio shrugs
<lordcirth> khayyam: Do u use bindist?  [23:33]
<khayyam> lordcirth: actually, no I don't have it set
<lordcirth> khayyam: So you don't need bindist to be completely libre?  [23:34]
<khayyam> lordcirth: it may also effect TLS .. but it some time back since I
	  looked at the ebuild
<reisio> bindist doesn't always do the same thing on every package, too, IIRC
									  [23:35]
<reisio> sometimes it disables things sometimes it enables
<khayyam> lordcirth: do you recognise patents?  [23:36]
<lordcirth> khayyam: What do u mean?
<khayyam> lordcirth: well, MS has a patent on "an electronic magazine"  [23:37]
<lordcirth> khayyam: just switched from webchat to irssi, I miss something?
<khayyam> lordcirth: so 'libre' (meaning non patent encumberd) can be tricky ITR
									  [23:38]
<lordcirth> khayyam: Well its more the specific code that I care about. I'm not
	    actually going to mod my code much. Its more the spirit of freedom
									  [23:40]
<theadmin> I seriously wonder why there is no Xfce profile
<lordcirth> theadmin: maybe they think that then they'd have to add LXDE &
	    Openbox/Fluxbox etc
<theadmin> lordcirth: Well, I guess it's not too difficult to setup, given that
	   the ebuilds exist anyway  [23:41]
<reisio> theadmin: because not using the GNOME profile (or KDE profile)
	 basically is the Xfce profile
<reisio> they might make one eventually, though :p
<khayyam> lordcirth: agreed, all I'm pointing to is that 'libre' isn't exactly a
	  technical term  [23:42]

<Guest7691> I have no idea what this is? any help..
<mingdao> Guest7691: define "this" please.
<nawks> Guest7691: this is #gentoo.  Identify or be destroyed.  [00:47]
<mingdao> nawks: Whoa there, pilgrim!
<Guest7691> I thought this was a chat room, to chat but I have no idea what you
	    are talking about
<theadmin> Guest7691: This is Freenode IRC, the channel of the only true Linux
	   distro in existence, Gentoo.
<Guest7691> oh  [00:48]
<lionrouge> tell me please for videocard that uses the last version of
	    prop.NVidia's driver is nouveau a good alternative?
<mingdao> Guest7691: You are in #gentoo ... Gentoo Linux Support
<kutsuya> Guest7691: This is a four letter word, that is currently an undefined
	  pronoun.
<nawks> +1 kutsuya  [00:49]
<iamben> lionrouge: it depends on where your priorities are
<mingdao> theadmin: FreeNode is actually the network.
<theadmin> Someone should fix the URLs in the topic... Either use http:// on all
	   of them or on none.
<theadmin> mingdao: I know, I meant as in "Planet Earth, USA, Washington DC.",
	   you know?  [00:50]
<lionrouge> stability, smooth and fast work, lowest possible resources use
<mingdao> theadmin: They run out of space and can't always use a full URI.
<mingdao> lionrouge: Do you need hwaccel? 3d?
<iamben> lionrouge: proprietary is better on 3d performance and power
	 management, nouveau is better in most other ways
<theadmin> mingdao: They use it on one URL currently though
<lionrouge> yes i do
<lionrouge> thanks  [00:51]
<mingdao> theadmin: You could query bonsaikitten on that perhaps?
<iamben> wrt topic-- who cares?
<iamben> is someone genuinely confused by it?
<nawks> yeah, who reads topic?
<mingdao> theadmin: I'm a click to launch fellow, also; but there are only so
	  many characters that can be in the topic.
<theadmin> mingdao: Yeah, makes sense  [00:52]
<iamben> one single URL has http:// where it doesnt' need it, it's not that big
	 of an issue.  the topic is constantly changing anyway, it's not like
	 we're printing up posters that will be up for 10 years
<theadmin> True, I guess
<theadmin> I wonder what that "masked by license" is all about, but I can't
	   click it so won't check, also I have ACCEPT_LICENSE="*" anyway.
									  [00:53]
<mingdao> theadmin: cp/paste
<theadmin> Heh, just brought me to the handbook, which I read already anyway
									  [00:54]
<mingdao> theadmin: Not everyone is using a kewl vt which does URL launching
	  anyway. ;)
<iamben> theadmin: not too long ago, non-interactive EULA license restrictions
	 were brand new.  and autounmask wasn't turned on by default.  so there
	 was a good reason for that link in the URL, it was coming up 20x a day.
									  [00:55]
<mingdao> Anyone have ideas to check why a card reader (attached via USB port)
	  will read SATA drives but not CF or SD cards?  [00:56]
<mingdao> I just throw this out every now and then when the channel isn't busy.
<iamben> mingdao: do you have scsi multi-lun support?  [00:57]
<mingdao> yes
<mingdao> workstation ~ # zgrep SCSI_MULTI /proc/config.gz  [00:58]
<mingdao> CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN=y
<mingdao> This same card reader *used* to work on this computer running Gentoo,
	  and works today on another computer running Windows 7.
<mingdao> And that's ... just ... not ... right!
<iamben> some readers need more than just plain usb storage support, but i've
	 never had one like that, so i'm not sure exactly what else to check for

<nawks> mingdao: your "card reader" has an sata port?  [01:11]
<nawks> mingdao: give the vendor:product string  [01:16]
<mingdao> nawks: Yes, it has SATA. The output was from inserting/removing SATA
	  drive, inserting CF card, and SD card.  [01:17]
<mingdao> nawks: 0bda:0151 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Mass Storage Device
	  (Multicard Reader)
<khayyam> lordcirth: emerge app-portage/pfl ... you can then run e-file

									  [01:18]
<nawks> i have that same device mingdao
<nawks> remember to put your cards in upside down ;)  [01:19]
<mingdao> nawks: There are 2 lights on the card reader. When I insert the SATA
	  the bottom light blinks blue. When I insert the CF card the top light
	  comes on green and stays on.
<mingdao> You can't.
<mingdao> put them in upside down
<nawks> pins up
<nawks> for the sd card that is
<mingdao> If you do with CF card, you'd break the pins of side plastic.  [01:20]
<mingdao> CD card has different sized slots on each side.
<nawks> the bottom slots are upside down
<mingdao> For mine the SD card goes pins down.  [01:21]
<mingdao> SATA goes upside down.
<nawks> did you look closely into the slot?  you can see the pins in it
<verty_> mingdao: you've tried all this in win7, right?
<mingdao> My card reader is Rosewill ..
<mingdao> verty_: Yes.
<nawks> mine is rosewill too  [01:22]
<mingdao> verty_: Different box with different mobo, but same card reader.
<verty_> mingdao: and same orientation of the cards, of course
<mingdao> nawks: Sounds like your card reader is mounted upside down.
<mingdao> verty_: yes
<verty_> nawks: have you checked what kernel drivers/support you have enabled?
									  [01:24]
<mingdao> Mine is Rosewill RDCR-11001 ... no page on their website.
<nawks> mingdao: i read "rosewill" on the front panel, not "llıʍǝsoɹ"
<mingdao> verty_: Yes.
<mingdao> nawks: Me, too.
<nawks> it doesn't need any support beyond usb_storage  [01:25]
<verty_> this is like listening to tweedledum and tweedledee
<mingdao> nawks: So I hear.
<nawks> there is an option power saving kernel module for it though
<nawks> i've had it working with and without that module
<verty_> what about verbose debugging, can that be enabled?  [01:26]
<verty_> --> mingdao, nawks  [01:27]
<nawks> mingdao: ok, yours is diff.  mine is rcr-IC001
<mingdao> verty_: Rather overfill.
<nawks> yours must have a separate usb/sata bridge chip
<mingdao> s/overfill/overkill
<verty_> back in 5 :)  [01:28]
<mingdao> nawks: No, just a USB cable and SATA power cable.
<nawks> i mean internally >:
<mingdao> could be...  [01:29]
<mingdao> Thing is, it used to work. I have a script for removing files from the
	  CF card.
<nawks> does it have 1 or two usb connections to the mobo?
<nawks> should be two prob
<mingdao> https://gist.github.com/3439103
<mingdao> one
<nawks> well they do die... cheap devices  [01:30]
<mingdao> It only has one USB cable.
<nawks> but it is a double row connector?  that would be two usb ports
<mingdao> It's not dead when I remove it from this PC and put it in another PC
	  running Windows 7 and all readers work fine. ;)
<nawks> can you find in dmesg or messages where it finds it and pastebin?
									  [01:31]
<nawks> also pastebin lsusb
<mingdao> No, nawks ... there is one plug for a USB 10-pin header on the mobo.
<nawks> yes, thats what i mean, two rows of 5, is two usb ports on there  [01:32]
<nawks>
	http://attachments.techguy.org/attachments/135336d1216256944/standard-usb-pinout.gif
<mingdao> nawks: No. That is ONE port ... it goes on ONE 10-pin header on the
	  mobo.
<mingdao> Trust me, this I know.
<nawks> denied  [01:33]
<lordcirth> So is the "radeon" driver the best choice for a HD5830? (fglrx is

<verty_> nawks: why do you say that?  [01:38]
<edoceo> how do I remove a package from the "system" list - seems like
	 java-config is now required - but I don't want it  [01:39]
<mingdao> nawks: Those are just users, but doesn't mean it's not fact.
<verty_> anyway, I've never heard of a fault that means it works but not on
	 linux, I don't think that is possible
<mingdao> Wonder if it's hot-swappable ... moving it to another USB header with
	  the box running?  [01:40]
<verty_> mingdao: do any of the ports/cards work?
<mingdao> verty_: And at some point in the past it *did* work on *this* PC with
	  Gentoo.
<khayyam> edoceo: add it to profile/package.provided
<mingdao> verty_: Yes, SATA works fine.
<mingdao> verty_: https://paste.lugons.org/show/HVvgeWZ9W8wwtwNf0ZEF/
<verty_> well sata is a 2 wires, I think, the others will be more, it could be a
	 dud header
<verty_> has 2 wires  [01:41]
<verty_> or 3 wires, signal each way and power, etc
<mingdao> verty_: Can I move it's USB cable to another header on the mobo while
	  running?
<nawks> mingdao: i've hotswapped usb (and sata) on mobo but be very careful of
	bending pins, shorting things, misaligning pins, etc.
<verty_> mingdao: almost certainly
<verty_> mingdao: although it may need to boot to detect the device
<nawks> mingdao: DISCONNECT YOUR SATA POWER FIRST
<mingdao> I had *one* of these Asus mobos which used to reboot with USB devices

<lordcirth>  khayyam: cool thx
<nawks> mingdao: from root run 'udevadm monitor'  and plug in a card.  see if

<khayyam> lordcirth: np ... you probably missed that same msg posted when you
	  asked about mkfs.vfat
<nawks> the ata bridge is working.  we dont have to worry about that one

<nand`> What does RESTRICT mean? I see it mentioned in the eix and portage man
	pages but no real explanation of what it is
<TitanOfOld> nand`: It restricts certain steps from happening.  [02:07]
<khayyam> nand`: like --fetch  [02:08]
<TitanOfOld> nand`: RESTRICT="fetch" prevents a package from automatically
	     downloading a file.
<TitanOfOld> nand`: RESTRICT="test" prevents src_test() from running.
<verty_> mingdao: a guess, CONFIG_RTS5139?  [02:09]
<nand`> TitanOfOld: why not just not provide a src_test() ?
<nand`> or provide one that's empty
<TitanOfOld> Without a src_test() in the ebuild, the default will run
	     instead. An empty one will be a no-op but it doesn't fail.
									  [02:10]
<TitanOfOld> nand`: What you propose there provides no feedback to those who

<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, how do you start Xorg ?
<annihilator> startx
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, what is in ~/.xinitrc ?

<annihilator> its blank  [02:22]
<verty_> tsousa: if you can work out where to put it, I think it will work just

<annihilator> but atm im doin startx from root
<tsousa> verty_: do you know where to put it?
<verty_> annihilator: don't load x with root, not secure
<annihilator> it was only temporary  [02:23]
<verty_> tsousa: unfortunately I don't, somewhere in /lib/firmware I guess
<annihilator> until i can get everything setup

<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, emerge -1 twm xterm xclock  [02:27]
<annihilator> lets hope this works with enlightenment or im just gonna install a

<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, that will make twm work.  You need to find out what
	       to put in ~/.xinitrc  for enlightenment  [02:30]
<annihilator> but would i need twm if i get the lines for xinitrc?  [02:31]
<khayyam> annihilator: no, simply add exec /path/to/wm  [02:32]

<khayyam> annihilator: to ~/.xinitrc
<annihilator> ok
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, no
<mingdao> nawks: # CONFIG_USB_ANNOUNCE_NEW_DEVICES is not set -- but nothing USB
	  has problems, and the SATA drive plugged into that card reader works.
<mingdao> so that one makes no sense to me
<khayyam> annihilator: so in your case (probably) 'exec /usr/bin/enlightenment'
									  [02:33]
<oldwzd> is the gentoo iso usb bootable? memstick that is
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, thats really a debug option.  udev should handel USB hot

<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: What do you think is wrong?
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao not CONFIG_USB_ANNOUNCE_NEW_DEVICES anyway  [02:34]
<mingdao> right
<mingdao> I doubt it's that CONFIG_RTS5139 in staging because it worked on some
	  earlier kernel.
<verty_> mingdao: does it from from a livecd?  [02:35]
<verty_> sorry, does it work from...
<khayyam> oldwzd: you might want to follow the procedure here:
	  http://www.sysresccd.org/Sysresccd-manual-en_How_to_install_SystemRescueCd_on_an_USB-stick
<mingdao> verty_: Not the latest SystemRescueCd, no.  [02:36]
<khayyam> oldwzd: this is for a sysrescecd 'USB stick' ... but it can also be
	  used as install medium
<khayyam> oldwzd: its also 'gentoo based' and can be used for all kinds of
	  'rescue' situations, and generally has better network driver support
	  than the gentoo minimal  [02:37]
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, I have not been following ...
<verty_> NeddySeagoon:  here is a very short summary, the device is 0bda:0151,

	 works, the card reading doesn't, but works on another machine with
	 win7.  Kernel support seems to be correct, but doesn't work
									  [02:38]
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: I have an USB card reader which reads a SATA drive, but
	  not CF card or SD card.
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: It works if I take it out of workstation and put it into
	  a Windows 7 machine.
<NeddySeagoon> verty_, You need Scan all LUNs under SCSI  [02:39]
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: It did work with the CF card at some point in the past,
	  because I have a script to cp files off it.
<verty_> NeddySeagoon: although it was before I arrived that the kernel support
	 stuff was checked, I suggested that after googling
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: Have that.
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao Scan all LUNs

<anxt> can someone toss one up on the web for me?  [02:41]
<anxt> i mean i could ebuild digest it i guess
<nawks> NeddySeagoon: CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN=y, we covered that  [02:42]
<khayyam> anxt: have you run 'file' on the resultant *.bin to see if it is
	  infact a bin?
<NeddySeagoon>  mingdao I guess you have SCSI disk and SCSI Generic support too
	       ?
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: https://paste.lugons.org/show/AJ5L9JYRYPAGT25IDFR1/
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: Some output there.  [02:43]
<anxt> khayyam: what is a bin?
<khayyam> anxt: "jdk-6u33-linux-x64.bin"
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: zgrep SCSI /proc/config.gz ->
	  https://paste.lugons.org/show/J6RqvkOj7JIFeR4UYT9A/
<anxt> khayyam: looks a hell of a lot like a shell script to me
<annihilator> Thx that khayyam  that workd  [02:44]
<anxt> khayyam: it is maybe something like a sharcive
<khayyam> annihilator: your welcome
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, see lines 1059..1061 that shows LUNs working
<nawks> mingdao: i'm pretty sure you have this set, but check...  BLK_DEV_SD
<anxt> kylen: file says its data, hexdump shows a shebang  [02:45]
<khayyam> anxt: I'm not sure what format it is ... but to be sure its not 'html'
	  or what-have-you
<anxt> khayyam: : file says its data, hexdump shows a shebang
<anxt> khayyam: the size is sane
<mingdao> CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y CONFIG_USB_STORAGE=y CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_REALTEK=m
<khayyam> anxt: ok .. well, your probably safe to run ebuild *.ebuild digest
									  [02:46]
<khayyam> anxt: sorry 'manifest'
<khayyam> anxt: digest is depreciated
<anxt> khayyam: hmm, i guess.  why doesnt someone fix the files?
<nawks> mingdao: so its seeing your reader just fine.  have you tried a few
	different cards?  sounds like hw issue
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, so your card reader is /dev/sd[cde] depending what sort
	       of card you put into it
<anxt> khayyam: its been like this for a week
<khayyam> anxt: no idea .. I guess as no one has reported it on b.g.o
<nawks> mingdao: or else maybe udev is strangely broken
<anxt> khayyam: what is b.g.o?  [02:47]
<khayyam> anxt: bugs.gentoo.org
<anxt> ahh
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: It is for SATA ... nothing else reads atm.
<verty_> mingdao: what is sdf?
<mingdao> nawks: Same cards work on other comps.
<nawks> mingdao: the kernel is recognizing your card reader  [02:48]
<mingdao> verty_: /dev/sdf1: UUID="48C0E9DFC0E9D2EC" TYPE="ntfs"   a SATA drive
	  plugged into the card reader
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, not even with fdosk ?
<verty_> mingdao: ok, thanks
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: ?
<anxt> i am pleased as a pig in shit to see the emacs24 in amd64 stable
<verty_> that's the swedish version
<mingdao> anxt: language
<mingdao> anxt: Though that's "mighty pleased" not in the vernacular.  [02:49]
<verty_> or... over the moon
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, in that case your card reader is two different USB
	       devices.  You may need usb_modeswitch
<khayyam> or simply 'happy'
<anxt> i am excited to see the best editor known to mankind in its somewhat
       latest incarnation in stable, too bad its gplv3  [02:50]
<khayyam> anxt: beg to differ :)
<anxt> i REALLY want to have fisticuffs or a good arm wrestle with RMS one day.
<verty_> anxt: not here plz, trolling is not liked :)
<benneh> after switching from nouveau to the closed source nvidia drivers, x
	 starts fine, but after ~45 seconds the screen goes black and my laptop
	 becomes completely unresponsive. what could cause a problem like that?
<mingdao> nawks: Where did you see the Jmicron?
<anxt> verty_: i dont think people still flame war over editors in the year 2012
       :)  [02:51]
<anxt> verty_: i certainly wouldnt bother :)
<khayyam> benneh: haven't you been asking this very same question for +2 days
	  now?
<nawks> mingdao: in this paste... http://bpaste.net/show/87JYcSPtmdmekrAUUyGR/
	i was just noticing it went away in last one..  or did you not copy
	enough?
<anxt> how do i tell not to file a duplicate bug?  [02:52]
<benneh> khayyam: yeah, lots of people have suggested lots of different things,
	 but so far nothing has worked :/ (if people are getting annoyed at the
	 repetition, just say so and i'll give up)
<khayyam> anxt: search :)
<mingdao> nawks: just now: Bus 002 Device 006: ID 152d:2329 JMicron Technology
	  Corp. / JMicron USA Technology Corp. JM20329 SATA Bridge  [02:53]
<khayyam> benneh: ok, I wanted to make sure it wasn't multiple people with the
	  same issue
<nawks> mingdao: i see you have usblp loaded, probably shouldn't
<verty_> benneh: have you followed all the guides that there may be?
<mingdao> nawks: But the card reader: Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0151 Realtek
	  Semiconductor Corp. Mass Storage Device (Multicard Reader)
<benneh> verty_: all that i've seen yes
<anxt> "jdk-6u33-linux-x64.bin checksum" zarro boogs found, so i can make a bug
       report?
<anxt> i dont want to be one of those noobz
<nawks> mingdao: so you see the jmicron moved also when you changed headers
<mingdao> nawks: Probably shouldn't if I used USB printer, but only
	  networked. Thanks for mentioning, I will remove it from .config.
									  [02:54]
<arthur___> hi, my usb flash drive lost its partition table. do i just use
	    mkfs.vfat and i am good again?
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, it looks like it works ... can you post
	       /proc/bus/usb/devices please
<khayyam> anxt: just seach for the package name (sans version) and check the
	  most recent
<DE> hello all
<nawks> arthur___: depends on if you mean filesystem instead of "partition"
<anxt> khayyam: aparently the tracker doesnt have full text search  [02:55]
<khayyam> anxt: your more likely to find it if someone has reported
<nawks> arthur___: but sure, try formatting fs first
<mingdao> nawks: Do you think any of this in 3.5.2 is pertinent?
	  http://ompldr.org/vZjdwdw
<anxt> khayyam: "java checksum" returned 0
<NeddySeagoon> arthur___ yes.  If you make the partition with the same start
	       addresses, you should get your data back too
<khayyam> anxt: package name
<anxt> khayyam: this is why i never file bug reports, its a pite
<nawks> mingdao: nope.  don't worry about the jmicron, that does your sata and
	it is ok
<DE> I am a new sabayon user and I notice that gentoo has a peice of software in
     its repostiores that Sabyaon does not. I would Like to get that package but
     dont know how to go about it since Im new
<arthur___> i still have data on it that i don't want to lose, so a dd backup
	    would be a good thought  [02:56]
<Vinky> anxt, thats because you're doing it wrong.  package name is sun-jdk
* NeddySeagoon passes DE the flame proof overcoat
<khayyam> DE: gentoo != sabayon
<nawks> arthur___: can you copy the data or not?  [02:57]
<khayyam> NeddySeagoon: hehe
<NeddySeagoon> arthur___ yes
<Vinky> DE, ask in #sabayon
<nawks> arthur___: i mean can you copy files or not?
<arthur___> no, not accessible, can mount it anymore
<DE> its too bad sabayon IRC is not as active or as quick to replt as this
     one. Another plus for gentoo
<verty_> arthur___: you should be able to write the partition table without
	 affecting the data
<nawks> is there an fsck for vfat, anyone?  [02:58]
<anxt> Vinky: ok, now i need a blasted account.
<arthur___> hope i am not mixing up the terminology here
<nawks> ah, yes there is... arthur___, try fsck.vfat on your unmounted flash
<NeddySeagoon> arthur___, use dd to make an image, then mount the image.  You
	       will need to guess offset= values
<khayyam> DE: and there is a reason for that .. gentoo is a "community based
	  arround a distribution" (true story)
<DE> I just thought since sabayon is based on gentoo that I can still acess the
     packages from gentoo that sab does not have
*** Jimmothy_ (~james@5ad44fb3.bb.sky.com) is now known as Jimmothy
<verty_> DE: perhaps you can, but this channel is for gentoo only, sorry  [02:59]
<Vinky> de, maybe, many gentoo users dont know how sabayon does its things
<Vinky> *but many
<nawks> mingdao: CONFIG_USB_ANNOUNCE_NEW_DEVICES=y ?
<DE> okay thanks anyways. take car  [03:00]
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, it looks like it works ... can you post
	       /proc/bus/usb/devices please
<verty_> nawks: been there, it isn't needed
<nawks> isn't needed ???  [03:01]
<verty_> nawks: do you disagree?
<nawks> verty_: you're right, its a debug option.  i like it tho :P  [03:02]
<verty_> NeddySeagoon: we did change to another usb header, from bus 3 to bus 2,
	 just in case that mattered  [03:04]
<arthur___> thanks, doing the backup now, what do you mean by offset value
	    NeddySeagoon?
<anxt> ok, signing up for teh lil account
<anxt> i am being a citizen today!
<arthur___> found the info, thanks for pointing in the right direction  [03:05]
<khayyam> anxt: you get a badge of commendation from El Presedente :)  [03:06]
<lordcirth> If radeon-ucode contains non-free firmware, why doesn't deblob or
	    bindist block it?
<khayyam> lordcirth: I believe you have to disable 'firmware loading'
<Vinky> lordcirth, doesnt deblob only work on in-kernel firmware?  [03:07]
<lordcirth> khayyam: Oh loading is disabled, I definetly  have a non-functional
	    GPU. But I'm wondering why radeon-ucode installed  [03:08]
<lordcirth> Vinky: That's the primary point, but I thought it did other stuff
	    too.
<lordcirth> khayyam: Problem is, do I have other non-free stuff hiding in my
	    system?  [03:09]
<NeddySeagoon> arthur___, read man mount.  If you know where your partition
	       starts in bytes from the start of the drive, then mount -o
	       offset=<bytes> /dev/sda /mnt/someplace mouts the parttition
	       starting bytes down the drive.  You don't need the partition
	       table
<khayyam> lordcirth: CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="" perhaps
<NeddySeagoon> verty_, I was thinking about bus power overload
<Vinky> "deblob: remove binary blobs from kernel sources...".  radeon-ucode is
	not part of the kernel
<lordcirth> Vinky: I see. Is there another pkg/flag that will keep the system
	    libre?  [03:10]
<nawks> NeddySeagoon: there *are* lights on the device
<nawks> mingdao: what do your indicator lights do when you plug in sd card?
<mingdao> neurodamage: I have no /proc/bus/usb/devices  Here's some output:
	  https://paste.lugons.org/show/LiLS11iDv9DdlnPifH1E/
<khayyam> lordcirth: ACCEPT_LICENSE  [03:11]
<nawks> NeddySeagoon: -^
<NeddySeagoon> nawks, that may not indicate anything
<mingdao> nawks: SD card ... top light turns on and stays on green
<khayyam> lordcirth: ACCEPT_LICENSE="-* @FSF-APPROVED"
<nawks> NeddySeagoon: i have one of these too.  there is a power light, and
	another one that comes on wit insertion
<mingdao> nawks: I forgot ... I took a photo for you earlier.
<nawks> mingdao: ok thats good
<mingdao> nawks: Don't know ... when the SATA (working device) is plugged in the
	  bottom light blinks blue.  [03:12]
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, can we see /proc/bus/usb/devices please so we can
	       seeyour whole USB tree
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: 14:10:50< mingdao> neurodamage: I have no
	  /proc/bus/usb/devices
<mingdao> Sorry, wrong tab complete
<lordcirth> khayyam: I have ACCEPT_LICENSE="-* @FREE"
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: I have no /proc/bus/usb/devices  Here's some output:
	  https://paste.lugons.org/show/LiLS11iDv9DdlnPifH1E/
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao :(  its a kernel option, now deprciated
<mingdao> nawks: http://ompldr.org/vZjdxOQ  [03:13]
<nawks> NeddySeagoon: how to check for udev problem?  [03:14]
<nawks> seems like no kernel msg going out
<mingdao> I sure appreciate all you knowledgable guys helping me.
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: I am on 3.5.2 on this workstation.
<NeddySeagoon> nawks, the first step is /proc/bus/usb/devices but dmesg shows it
	       working properly  [03:15]
<nawks> mingdao: can you boot older kernel to test?  you said it worked before
	right?
<mingdao> nawks: I have before with no difference.
<NeddySeagoon> nawks, mingdao does it work if there is a card in the drive at
	       boot ?
<mingdao> nawks: And I have removed all but vmlinuz-3.5.0 now.
<anxt> so i search "sun-jdk" for bugs and i get no bugs, is this correct?
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: ++smoke test++ that now
<verty_> anxt: what is the bug?
<anxt> verty_: the checksum fails in the digests  [03:16]
<anxt> verty_: fetch the distfile 3 times.
<verty_> anxt: in the ebuild, right?  when did you find it like that the first
	 time, how long ago?
<anxt> verty_: maybe 1 week ago  [03:17]
<khayyam> lordcirth: I'm not sure of all the particulars of licences ... but
	  @FSF-APPROVED is whats provided in the GLEP
<verty_> anxt: what is the exact message?  I'm wondering if it is the actual
	 distfile that failed or the ebuild
<lordcirth> khayyam: I tried using @FSF_APPROVED on my last setup. It flagged
	    stuff in the stage3  [03:18]
<verty_> anxt: sometimes what happens is, the download fails and a broken
	 distfile remains, and basically blocks it until that partial file is
	 removed
<anxt> verty_: it renames the file to a stange extension, due to failed checksum
<anxt> verty_: i rm * of the old ones.
<Vinky> anxt, how did you get version 6u33, I only see 6u34 and 6u32 on those
	pages  [03:19]
<verty_> anxt: also the md5sum and umd5sum files?
<anxt> Vinky: i went searching on teh internet.
<lordcirth> khayyam: Just changed ACCEPT_LICENSES, how do I scan/ reload it?
<verty_> lordcirth: it should just work
<theadmin> lordcirth: it just works
<anxt> verty_: you mean from oracle md5 sum+  [03:20]
<annihilator> whats a good bluetooth manager?
<khayyam> lordcirth: you could do an emerge -epv --deep @world
<khayyam> lordcirth: actually --deep is not required there
<anxt> http://pastebin.ca/2197644 this is the checksums i got
<mingdao> workstation ~ # dmesg | wgetpaste  [03:21]
<mingdao> Your paste can be seen here: http://bpaste.net/show/41728/
<lordcirth> khayyam: [ U ] is uninstall right?
<anxt> a quick google of
       "978daf43e7fc302220174a16aecaf54d5e9b72f1cd1681f36ab14a2b4bad5fd4" shows
       gentoo pages  [03:22]
<verty_> anxt: delete anything from distfiles that starts jdk-6u33, then try it
	 once more, just in case, but if you have done this before, you don't
	 need to redo it
<anxt> verty_: been down that road
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon:  http://bpaste.net/show/41728/  with SATA drive, CF
	  card, SD card, Micro SD
<verty_> anxt: does 6u32 or 6u34 work?
<anxt> verty_: i would assume, they are not in stable
<nawks> mingdao: wheee!  so somehow kernel msg is not getting out to udev
									  [03:23]
<nawks> when u hotplug the cards
<verty_> anxt: that's your best bet, using another version
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: Glory! Looks like it's got 3 of them:
	  https://paste.lugons.org/show/6K8C2EAwoc5UBu3qaksc/
<nawks> mingdao: what i was already thinking of is, what vers of linux-headers
	and udev u have?  maybe upgrade headers to 3.5 and rebuild udev?
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, the cards are seen
<anxt> verty_: what about just having it fixed?  I signed up for a bugzilla
       account, it seems sorta sloppy to leave it unfixed.  [03:24]
<khayyam> lordcirth: sorry, busy ... [U] == update
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao and so are the partitions.  It looks like the reader does
	       not send media changed events
<verty_> anxt: it might not be worth fixing, if there is a 6u32 and 6u34 and
	 both work, who cares then, right?
<markand> I have a wierd bug, my synaptics touchpad is locked on "vertical
	  scroll" everywhere I touch the pad it scrolls
<markand> vertically
<lordcirth> khayyam: And R is rebuild?
<verty_> anxt: or I should say, may not be worth fixing  [03:25]
<anxt> verty_: makes the distro look lame, though.
<lordcirth> khayyam: or Remove?
<khayyam> kokeroulis: [R] = replace
<nawks> NeddySeagoon: could be that, or a kernel/udev issue
<khayyam> lordcirth: [R] = replace (so the version will be reinstalled)
<nawks> he says it worked before and works in win
<mingdao> Seems /dev/sdd1: UUID="eacc9273-3ab7-4288-88d7-5cea69a84c99"
	  TYPE="ext2" is the SD card; still might not have seen the Micro SD.
<NeddySeagoon> nawks it cold be a hardware issue
<anxt> verty_: actually there are no 32 or 34 ebuilds, so i would hafta copy one
       and edit it.
<lordcirth> khayyam: As in, recompile and replace?
<verty_> anxt: Vinky said it was missing from portage, perhaps it was removed
	 for just that reason
<khayyam> lordcirth: yes
<anxt> verty_: so right now, no stable users can have sun java  [03:26]
<Vinky> verty_, what when?
<lordcirth> khayyam: So if everything is U or R, its safe to remove -p?
<Vinky> anxt, blame oracle for that
<verty_> anxt: forget sun java, geez, I didn't know we were talking about this.
	 This is a waste of time, leave sun java well alone
<khayyam> lordcirth: most packages are probably [R] because they would be
	  reinstalled by --empty-tree
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: What to do for "media changed events"?
<lordcirth> khayyam: (Just making sure, already borked this once today)
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, there is a polling option somewhere
<khayyam> lordcirth: no, -e will rebuild everything
<anxt> Vinky, verty_ to just say "the software isnt free enough blame oracle" is
       sorta lame.  iced-tea isnt an option for me  [03:27]
<khayyam> lordcirth: just see what changes would occur on selected packages
<khayyam> lordcirth: brb .. making tea
<verty_> anxt: what is oracle's jdk called?
<anxt> its frustrating that i took time, looked into it signed up for a bug
       account, and i am told to forget it
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, devices with removable media are supposed to signal the
	       kernel when media is inserted/removed.  Not all do.  There is a
	       polling option somewhere as a workaround  [03:28]
<anxt> verty_: i would assume it is still called sun-jdk
<Vinky> anxt, the problem is oracle's redistribution restriction
<verty_> anxt: that seems wrong though, it isn't sun's jdk
<nawks> NeddySeagoon: i have the same realtek chip, it signals
<verty_> anxt: it was an one time, but now it isn't
<anxt> oh, eix tells me oracle-jdk 1.7
<Vinky> anxt, for version 7 sun-jdk has been renamed to oracle-jdk  [03:29]
* khayyam back
<verty_> anxt: you're talking about something perhaps 6 months old now, or close
	 to it, ancient in gentoo's terms
<anxt> i can switch to that i guess.
<anxt> verty_: well its not hard to believe someone might want to test something
       that is back compatible, seeing as how it is "development kit"
<verty_> anxt: I'm just being this way because sun's jdk has to be a dead-end,
	 whatever is in the future is oracle or icedtea  [03:30]
<khayyam> lordcirth: I suggested '-e' so that you'd have some idea of what
	  packages the licence change might effect
<anxt> verty_: well it comes across as dismissive, that i am foolish, at least
       over irc.  i am somewhat competent, actually
<mingdao> nawks: Do you think any of this in 3.5.2 is pertinent?
	  http://ompldr.org/vZjdwdw  [03:31]
<verty_> anxt: why not submit bug reports that make icedtea an option for you?
	 I don't think much attention will be paid to sun or java6 now
<anxt> verty_: the company i am with develops an applet that doesnt work
       correctly with iced-tea (maybe due to alsa)
<mingdao> nawks: You mentioned JMicron.
<anxt> verty_: it is a known icetea upstream issue
<lordcirth> khayyam: So if it doesn't want to remove anything, everything is
	    pure libre?  [03:32]
<nawks> mingdao: i already answered no.  a)  that's not your device.  b)  your
	jmicron is working
<verty_> anxt: is it a sound problem?
<mingdao> nawks: Missed your reply.
<nawks> mingdao: the jmicron does sata.  the realtek does mem cards
<trumee> anybody familiar with sox can help with this, http://pastie.org/4576274
	 ?
<anxt> verty_: yeah, iced-tea doesnt play with dmix, and anxt doesnt play with
       pulseaudio
<nawks> mingdao: linux-headers and udev vers plz

<trumee> i am reading from 'mic', increasing the volume and playing it back
<khayyam> lordcirth: well, I'm not exactly sure how licence effects the
	  dependency tree, but yes, I think so
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: CONFIG_EPOLL=y Enable eventpoll support ?  [03:34]
<anxt> verty_, Vinky thanks for your input, this will be workable solution, i
       think
<mingdao> nawks: Okay.
<lordcirth> khayyam: Cool, thx. Apparently it was just the CD that had non-FSF
	    approved stuff.
<verty_> anxt: ok, I was hoping you could place another also node in front of
	 dmix, to workaround the problem
<Vinky> anxt, anyway: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=431492
<verty_> alsa node
<verty_> anxt: I mean, if it was format conversion errors  [03:35]
<verty_> anxt: best of luck to you
<khayyam> lordcirth: I imagine that is the case ... the GLEP states that
	  @FSF-APPROVED, and so I can't see a stage3 being problematic ITR
<annihilator> where would i add lines like this "=sys-fs/udisks-1.99.0-r1"
<mingdao> nawks: linux-headers [I]3.5 and udev [I]171-r6
<verty_> annihilator: what do you want to achieve?
<anxt> Vinky: this is why i didnt file a report, i searched and searched and
       never found that  [03:36]
<annihilator> its when i emerge
<nawks> mingdao: does the file /sys/bus/usb/uevent exist?
<lordcirth> khayyam: I just ran emerge -a radeon-ucode , and it didn't flag it..
<annihilator> i forgot what file i needed to add that to for portage
<Vinky> anxt, I just searched  for sun-jdk on b.g.o
<mingdao> nawks: yes
<mingdao> workstation ~ # less /sys/bus/usb/uevent
<mingdao> /sys/bus/usb/uevent: Permission denied
<anxt> Vinky: me too.  maybe i did it wrong.  [03:37]

<mingdao> --w------- 1 root root 4096 Aug 23 09:19 /sys/bus/usb/uevent
<khayyam> lordcirth: it should say 'licence changes need to be applied before

<khayyam> lordcirth: it will probably do so if you =y  [03:39]
<annihilator> this is my error http://bpaste.net/show/41731/
<nawks> mingdao: have you reemerged udev recently?  especially since you
	upgraded linux-headers
<annihilator> when i try to emerge brasero and udisks
<khayyam> annihilator: thats not an error ... its information
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao try it
<annihilator> well for me its an error since its stoping me
<lordcirth> khayyam: I know, I tried skype and that flagged
<lordcirth> khayyam: It flagged before the y/n  [03:40]
<mingdao> nawks: workstation ~ # cat /etc/portage/package.mask
<mingdao> >=sys-fs/udev-181
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: try it = upgrade udev?
<khayyam> annihilator: its not stopping you ... it simply says that news items
	  are available  [03:41]
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao CONFIG_EPOLL=y
<mingdao> nawks: No, I haven't upgraded udev since the systemd integration
	  started on workstation.
<nawks> mingdao: i'm saying since you upgraded kernel and headers to 3.5, you
	prob need to re-emerge udev.  udev dependds on linux-headers
<annihilator> it wont install it just stops
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: Have it already. CONFIG_EPOLL=y
<NeddySeagoon> mingdaoAH OK
<khayyam> lordcirth: ok, in which case this *may* be an issue with the specific
	  ebuild  [03:42]
<nawks> mingdao: i'm not sure about going to udev-187 since that has some
	significant changes in system
<NeddySeagoon> nawks -187 is harmless unless you have separate /usr or /var
									  [03:43]
<nawks> ok
<mingdao> nawks: linux-headers-3.5 on 7/23 and udev on 6/11
<nawks> mingdao: well i'd try re-emerging same udev version first, then maybe
	try upgrading udev later  [03:44]
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: Since workstation has neither /var nor /usr separate, do
	  you think unmasking udev would help this issue?
<NeddySeagoon> mingdao, no
<nawks> mingdao: in the interest of step-by-step debugging, re-emerge stable
	version first
<verty_> NeddySeagoon: subtle change in hardware that the current driver doesn't
	 support?
<nawks> mingdao: when did you upgrade to 3.5 kernel?
<khayyam> annihilator: well, that 'error' provides nothing to go on as its just
	  the usual output when there is a news item to read  [03:45]
<NeddySeagoon> verty_ a rebuilt will be harmless - but why would hardware have
	       changed ?
<mingdao> nawks: Aug 15 22:35 vmlinuz-3.5.2
<annihilator> so the last 5 lines is just a news feed  [03:46]
<verty_> NeddySeagoon: yeah, surely it couldn't happen.  Ok, something else,
	 could modules versus built in change anything?
<nawks> mingdao: ok, so udev build is out of date with respect to those
<annihilator> that always occors when you merge any file?
<mingdao> nawks: just rebuilt it
<khayyam> annihilator: yes, when there is a news item to read
<annihilator> emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy
	      ">=sys-fs/udev-180[gudev,hwdb]".  [03:47]
<annihilator> that is a news feed?
<verty_> NeddySeagoon: sorry to pose such difficult questions :)
<annihilator> then why dont i get it when i emerged irssi
<annihilator> or emerged layman
<verty_> annihilator: that means you need to change use flags on udev
<khayyam> annihilator: *that* is not in the 'error' you posted
<annihilator> yes it is
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h  [03:48]

<annihilator> stuppid paste
<khayyam> annihilator: no it isn't, this is what you posted:
	  http://bpaste.net/show/41731/
<annihilator> yea i know i checked it the paste got ....up
<verty_> mingdao: I must ask my standard question... are you using the correct
	 usb driver, the one suggested by http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/ ?
<annihilator> that is why there was confusion
<verty_> I am now out of ideas  [03:49]
<annihilator> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=K9Azhz92
<annihilator> that is what it was supposed to be pasted
<mingdao> verty_: That's PCI  [03:50]
<verty_> mingdao: the usb controllers are shown in lspci
<verty_> mingdao: sorry, I meant the usb controller driver
<khayyam> annihilator: in that case you should ask on #funtoo  [03:51]
<theadmin> Ew, gentoo derivatives
<mingdao> verty_: http://bpaste.net/show/41734/
<mingdao> verty_: The USB ports work, just not all the cards are being read by
	  the card reader. But, 3 of 4 were when inserted before booting.
									  [03:52]
<chelovekkorzhik_> sorry, I can't start xmonad with Slim. There are only black
		 screen and mouse pointer in cross (I don't know name of this,

		 only with ~/.xinitrc), but I can't run it with Slim
									  [03:53]
<mingdao> nawks: Rebuilt udev, rebooted, plugged in CF card ... no output from
	  kernel ring buffer, same green light on all the time.
<mingdao> nawks: Same with SD card.  [03:54]
<nawks> grr
<khayyam> theadmin: no, they are sooooper cool, thats why #gentoo has so may of
	  them :)
<mingdao> nawks: But with the SATA drive, same as it ever was
	  ... http://bpaste.net/show/MqUguJQ9XmAtwMLquXAl/
<chelovekkorzhik_> xmonad version is 0.10
<theadmin> khayyam: Well, I tried Sabayon once... Never again.
<mingdao> NeddySeagoon: Any more ideas?  [03:55]
<nawks> mingdao: is that rts5139 module loaded?  [03:56]
<khayyam> theadmin: I should have used more sarcasm :)
<chelovekkorzhik_> somebody faced with such a situation?
<mingdao> nawks: I have no modules ... period ... lsmod is clean.
<nawks> mingdao: did you build the rts5139 (staging) or the realtek 51xx
	modules?
<mingdao> nawks: Neither.
<nawks> mingdao: you didn't make them built-in ?  [03:57]
<mingdao> nawks: It reads the cards when I boot with them plugged in ... why
	  would it need another driver?
<nawks> it doesn't need them.  wanted to make sure you don't have them
<mingdao> nawks: I will rebuild the kernel. It's a workstation, so rebooting and
	  setting stuff up is a royal PITA. It admins all the other comps on
	  this LAN, just for starters.  [03:58]
<nawks> mingdao: so lets try keywording udev and upgrade it?
<mingdao> nawks: So I don't want to be disagreeable, but ...
<nawks> i understand
<mingdao> nawks: So *don't* build those drivers?
<nawks> *don't*
<annihilator> if im using a live cd such as the sysrescuecd i can start from
	      quick install guide code listing 2.8
<mingdao> annihilator: no  [03:59]
<mingdao> annihilator: You can *only* use the Gentoo Handbook ... period.
<theadmin> mingdao: Or your mind. I did a couple installs from memory now, they
	   work out quite well.
<earendil> haha
<theadmin> Except I always forget the freaking grub  [04:00]
<annihilator> huh?
<annihilator> http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-quickinstall.xml so i cant
	      use that
<nawks> mingdao: the only we difference we have is that you are kernel 3.5.2 and
	i am 3.3.8
<theadmin> annihilator: Nah sure you can, they're joking around. That document
	   isn't marked out of date so it's good.  [04:01]
<annihilator> ..........
<theadmin> annihilator: If you're new though, please use the handbook, it will
	   explain more.
<nawks> mingdao: i'll try 3.5.2 in the next 24 hrs and see if that breaks my
	card reader
<khayyam> annihilator: basically both install guides can be used and followed
	  regardless of bootdisk  [04:02]
<khayyam> annihilator: the handbook is recommended because it give greater
	  context  [04:03]
<mingdao> nawks: Notice the Rosewill site doesn't even include a 11001
	  http://www.rosewill.com/products/21/149/217/667/series.htm
<trumee> anybody running gentoo on raspberry pi?
<annihilator> khayyam: im wanting to switch from funtoo cause A i get better
	      support here and B most guides i do utilize for some of the
	      programs i use are done in gentoo not in funtoo
<khayyam> annihilator: understandable  [04:04]
<mingdao> nawks: And none of those have SATA.
<annihilator> so im not new to installing funtoo
<nawks> mingdao: i think its discontinued.  seriously, people said it is
	miswired... it connects the sata +5v to the usb +5v...  danger!
<mingdao> trumee: Yes, but they are in #rpi-gentoo
<annihilator> i borked the boot drive cause the mount command did not take so i
	      ended up installed funtoo like 6 times...lol

<mingdao> trumee: Seriously, just ask your question and if someone can help they

<trumee> mingdao: is 3.2.27 better than 3.1.9 kernel?
<mingdao> verty_: Will look.
<mingdao> trumee: For what?
<city_wok> hi all
<trumee> mingdao: for sorting usb trouble  [04:09]
<mingdao> trumee: My opinion is latest version marked stable on kernel.org and
	  keep up with vulnerabilities is best on non-critical machines.
<mapee> after second kernel config  i hit make && make modules_install and cp
	arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/kernel-3.3.8-gentoo-r2 and my /boot/grub is
	gone, could anybody help? + i had this message during kernel compile:
	clock skew detected :/
<city_wok> question about google-talk-plugin, unmask from portage, or emerge
	   dependencies and use deb2targz on the .deb file released by google?
<verty_> trumee: try 3.4 instead, best I think (or 3.5)  [04:10]
<trumee> mingdao: ok, 3.1.9 is old then by your logic. However, patches go into
	 RPi official kernel rather than upstream
<trumee> verty_: does that kernel work on RPi?
<verty_> trumee: I don't know what that is, so no idea
<nawks> verty_: trumee:  no, 3.4 is not recommended... 3.3 or 3.5 is
<mingdao> verty_: The Linux drivers at that link are PCIe ... mine is USB.
									  [04:11]
<verty_> mingdao: that page "get to work on ubuntu" uses lsusb, then uses that
	 driver, what can I say?
<verty_> mingdao: I have no other suggestions but to install that anyway  [04:12]
<khayyam> mapee: sounds like /boot isn't mounted
<mingdao> verty_: If it hadn't worked before, and if it didn't work now with the
	  cards plugged in at boot, and if there wasn't an USB driver for that
	  chipset in the kernel ... I might consider it. But...
<mingdao> verty_: I might try the one in the kernel.
<verty_> mingdao: I didn't see a 5159, only 5139, but I'm tired now  [04:13]
<mingdao> verty_: Realtek RTS5139 USB card reader support
<mapee> khayyam, thanks
<mingdao> verty_: It's in staging in 3.5.2 where I'm looking.
<khayyam> mapee: your welcome
<blackiner> Anyone know if there is anything I can do to get Xorg working with

	    and kill it... logs don't really indicate any errors.
<mingdao> verty_: I see what you're on to now ... bcdDevice           51.95
									  [04:14]
<mapee> khayyam, could you tell me pls how can i fix the warning too? "clock
	skew detected" really annoying... :(
<mingdao> ??
<verty_> mingdao: ok, so it is there  [04:15]
<khayyam> mapee: your bios clock is probably set to the wrong time
<mingdao> verty_: What is bcdDevice           51.95 and what does it have to do
	  with  5159 or 5139 and where can I find this fellow's chipset?
									  [04:16]
<mapee> khayyam, will check it thanks!
<khayyam> mapee: so when you boot the system thinks its 1970 or what-have-you
	  ... and of cource the kernel is being built in the future hence 'skew'
<mapee> khayyam, i see
<mapee> thx again

<sevensevensevens> Noob9, itsn hp, so I installed hplip
<mingdao> nawks: You said your card reader is the same, and you run 3.3.8?
<fgro> what to do?
<Noob9> sevensevensevens, i haven't done anything with HP printers lately, but
	basically until you see it in lsusb there's no point of messing around
	in cups  [04:31]
<Noob9> maybe google for your printer and lsusb, see what comes up ?  [04:32]
<sevensevensevens> nothing relevant on google unfortunately :(
<Noob9> sevensevensevens, when you plug it in and plug it out, do you get
	anything on dmesg ?  [04:33]
<nawks> mingdao: oic...  and change cpu and chipset, maybe ethernet
<nawks> mingdao: we went through every usb and fs option though.  you can look

<khayyam> fgro: its saying that xvmc requires +g3dvl
<sevensevensevens> Noob9, nothing under hp or 6100
<fgro> ok
<Noob9> sevensevensevens, try dmesg -c to clear the log, then plug it in and
	out, and dmesg again to see if anything pops  [04:35]
<nawks> sevensevensevens: do not use the kernel usblp.  libusb and cups handles
	it now  [04:36]
<sevensevensevens> Noob9, nothing

<khayyam> Toothpick: "update"
<Toothpick> khayyam: so how come it wasnt updated in "emerge -DaNuv" world?
									  [04:50]
<nawks> sevensevensevens: i'm looking
<mingdao> sevensevensevens: Is this it?
	  http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Printers/HP-Officejet/CB863A?HP-Officejet-6100-ePrinter-H611a
<nawks> sevensevensevens: in usb driver section, "usb printer support"
<khayyam> Toothpick: 'it' may be a bdep .. but I'd be guessing without knowing
	  what 'it' is
<sevensevensevens> mingdao, looks the same, not sure about the h611a  [04:51]
<tomm55> can you guys help me install glibc 2.16
<mingdao> sevensevensevens: Does yours have wired/wireless?
<tomm55> I'm new to gentoo but I can't figure out how to install that...
<nawks> sevensevensevens: the module that option makes is called usblp, thats
	why it gets called that sometimes
<sevensevensevens> mingdao, yes, it has wireless  [04:52]
<mingdao> sevensevensevens: If yours has this embedded webserver like mine,
	  forget the Linux USB support. Just use it networked. Here's a
	  screenshot: http://ompldr.org/vZjdzZQ
<mingdao> sevensevensevens: It works for any PC on my LAN; Linux, Windows, or
	  Mac.
<Toothpick> khayyam: http://bpaste.net/show/41745/
<sevensevensevens> mingdao, if USB didn't work I was going to get an ethernet
		 cable  [04:53]
<tomm55> well I added sys-libs/glibc to package.accept_keywords but it still
	 pulls glibc 2.15  [04:54]
<tomm55> is 2.16 not avaliable?
<msichal> check if you have a 2.16 ebuild in portage tree  [04:55]
<khayyam> Toothpick: two issues there .. the first is that coreutils can't be
	  updated because its blocked by realpath
<tomm55> ok
<khayyam> Toothpick: this is due to realpath being included in that version of
	  coreutils  [04:56]
<khayyam> Toothpick: so, unmerge realpath and coreutils should then update
<tomm55> yeah I do have a 2.16 ebuild in there
<mingdao> sevensevensevens: Mine is plugged into my switch and it is great. The
	  scan feature beats sane/xsane so badly it's not funny.
<tomm55> so what do I do with it to upgrade..?  [04:57]
<msichal> tomm55: try emerge -v =glibc-2.16
<khayyam> Toothpick: as its a 'b' (minor block) portage should deal with this
	  automatically with an --update
<tomm55> ok
<msichal> oh, i failed  [04:58]
<khayyam> Toothpick: the second issue is a masked package, which is slated for
	  removal in 30 days
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
*** s0ra_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as sora_h
<tomm55> ah ok thank you  [04:59]
<mingdao> Toothpick: "eix-sync && emerge -aDjNuv @world" will help with those
	  types of issues
<msichal> tomm55: that probably won't work, try emerge -v =sys-libs/glibc-2.16.0
<tomm55> I figured that out myself lol
<tomm55> but thanks
<mingdao> Toothpick: "emerge -aDjNuv @world" would tell you that realpath was
	  going to be removed
<tomm55> also, when upgrading it in the future
<msichal> it's masked **, so it's probably unstable or buggy
<tomm55> do I need to do it manually like that or will emerge do it when I use
	 the upgrade command
<tomm55> oh I see  [05:00]
<Toothpick> mingdao: what does the j help here? and what does it have to do with
	    masked packages?
<msichal> if you use ~arch keyword and it's masked by that you will need -u
	  option, and it should emerge that version
<mingdao> Toothpick: allows as many jobs as possible to be emerged simulaneously
<tomm55> so if when I upgrade my system later will I have to do emerge --update
	 --deep --with-bdeps=y world to upgrade glibc when 2.17 comes out
									  [05:01]
<tomm55> or will I have to do it by emerge -v =sys-libs/glibc2.17
<mingdao> Toothpick: the u (update) would have solved teh mask, as khayyam told
	  you
<msichal> tomm55: --update will install latest unmasked version, or masked with
	  accepted keywords  [05:02]
<tomm55> ah ok, sorry I'm just new to this
<mingdao> Toothpick: "man emerge" a (ask) D (deep) j (jobs) N (new) u (update) v
	  (verbose)
<Toothpick> mingdao: currently i'm in the process of "emerge -DaNuv world", will
	    i still have to run "emerge -DaNuvj world" afterwards?
<mingdao> Toothpick: no  [05:03]
<msichal> tomm55: no problem, i'm new too, you sometimes just need some help to
	  figure out some things
<mingdao> Toothpick: -j Specifies the number of packages to build
	  simultaneously. If this option is given without an argument, emerge
	  will not limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously.
<mingdao> Toothpick: Just keeps things going faster.
<tomm55> brb, compiling  [05:04]
<Toothpick> mingdao: but i already have MAKEOPTS="-j5" in my /etc/make.conf
<khayyam> anyone have a possible explanation as to why eix-sync (~arch) might
	  cause the following to occur: eix mutt .. No matches found.
									  [05:06]
<meingtsla> Toothpick: That's different
<Toothpick> it works on 5 threads, i know
<Toothpick> but physically -j in emerge does not make it any faster
<meingtsla> khayyam: Old cache file in /var/cache/eix? No idea
<khayyam> or eix glibc ... No matches found.
<tomm55> ahh..  [05:07]
<khayyam> meingtsla: nope ... removed, rebuild, all to no avail
<tomm55> I wanted to try using glibc 2.16 because 2.15 was giving me
	 complication errors and failing
<tomm55> seems 2.16 fails as well
<khayyam> it worked perfectly fine until I run eix-sync ...  [05:08]
<meingtsla> What happens if you run an eix-update? Wonder what it's doing to
	    screw things up  [05:09]
<meingtsla> Trying to think. Where is it writing to, and where is it reading
	    from
<khayyam> meingtsla: it updates, without issue, thought it seems to parse repo
	  gentoo way too fast  [05:10]
<meingtsla> Huh. Where is your portage tree located?
<tomm55> does anybody else have problems compiling glibc 2.15 or 2.16? it fails
	 and gives me an error but not sure what to do with it
<khayyam> meingtsla: I've run 'emaint all', cleared edb caches ... /usr/portage
<meingtsla> tomm55: I had issues on a vm running under xencenter but haven't had
	    time to look into it  [05:11]
<meingtsla> khayyam: What version of eix
<khayyam> mingdao: the ~arch app-portage/eix-0.26.3  [05:12]
<khayyam> meingtsla: but I've been running this same version for a few weeks
	  without issues  [05:13]
<meingtsla> Might be bug time
<tomm55> it does say ld returned 1 exit status if that helps
<tomm55> well it has a alot of errors....

<tomm55> is there anything I can do to help diagnose this problem?
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h  [05:15]
<meingtsla> tomm55: That by itself doesn't say much. If you provide the full
	    build log someone might be able to figure it out...though...Hmph
<tomm55> ok
<tomm55> it's on another machine
<tomm55> let me try and get it somehow
<annihilator> how do i go about getting 3.5.2
<annihilator> kernel
<khayyam> meingtsla: its not exactly my bug, but close ... it worked prior to
	  running eix-sync
<khayyam> annihilator: you would keyword that package  [05:16]
<tomm55> is there anywhere I can upload this log to?
<tomm55> and it's the build.log right?  [05:17]
<meingtsla> yeah. emerge wgetpaste to paste files from the commandline to a
	    pastebin
<khayyam> annihilator: something like =sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-3.5.2 in
	  /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
<meingtsla> I forget which one takes huge textfiles though
<tomm55> ok  [05:18]
<annihilator> which would be better doing it that way or putting
	      ACCEPTABLE_KEYWORDS="~amd64" in the make file?
<annihilator> accept*  [05:19]
<Frigolit> annihilator: putting it in /etc/portage/package.keywords is better
<khayyam> annihilator: ACCEPTABLE_KEYWORDS="~amd64" will change the entire
	  system to ~arch (unstable)
<tlhiv_laptop> where are the settings for slocate/updatedb ?  i would like to
	       make them run at a higher nice level
<Frigolit> if you globally set ~amd64 in make.conf, things will most likely
	   break in the long run
<khayyam> annihilator: package.accept_keywords is more selective
<annihilator> ok
<annihilator> well that could explain why funtoo breaks lol  [05:20]
<tomm55> alright it's installed
<tomm55> ok so how do I use wgetpaste
<khayyam> tomm55: wgetpast -S will show the <services> and wgetpaste -s
	  <service> /path/to/file to paste  [05:21]
<khayyam> tomm55: or command |wgetpaste
<tomm55> ok uploading it now  [05:24]
<khayyam> heh: ACCEPTABLE_KEYWORDS="~amd64"  [05:25]
<sevensevensevens> mingdao, do you read the bible on your computer?  [05:26]

<Jax> hello, i just ran: grub-install —no-floppy /dev/vda on two machines and it
      worked fine. i have another identical machine and running this command
      gives /dev/vda does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
<Jax> what can i do?
<Jax> mount shows /dev/vdaX partitions mounted and /dev/vda1 is the boot
      partition  [05:27]
<tomm55> so does it often take a long time for this to upload
<mingdao> Toothpick: MAKEOPTS in make.conf is to use parallel make. The -j
	  option (JOBS) with "emerge <blah>" is the number of jobs that can run
	  simultaneously.
<th3br0> hey guys got a question,  i want use conky with rss, i put the rss flag
	 in /etc/make.conf, but still doenst work, no such configuration:

<mingdao> gotta go ... RL
<sssilver> Hello gentlemen.
<tomm55> ok  [05:28]
<khayyam> th3br0: close the braces '${rss}'
<th3br0> my code is like this ${rss

<sssilver> So like, I'm sick of using hyphens when typing English text in

	   processor automatically convert hyphens to em-dashes and en-dashes
	   wherever grammatically appropriate?
<Toothpick> mingdao: but eventually it will take the same time on both cases

<jarray52> I'm trying to run the command `git clone

	   installed on Gentoo. The command fails.
<jarray52> I asked at #git, and some members suggested that it is a problem with
	   the git installation on my OS. Does anyone else using git have this
	   problem?
<tomm55> huh
<tomm55> the file seems uploaded to me
<tomm55> wait was I supposed to upload it to somebody else  [05:43]
<Jax> if i have 3 identical systems, i can just copy bzImage from one to

<movl> jarray52: how does the command fail?
<jarray52> movl: The command returns with no message. However, the repository is
	   not cloned.  [05:45]
<jarray52> echo $? gives 128
<khayyam> jarray52: no, git works fine, I can even clone that repo
<movl> jarray52: use git://  [05:46]
<jarray52> khayyam: What is your git version? `git --version`  [05:47]
<khayyam> jarray52: dev-vcs/git-1.7.8.6
<jarray52> khayyam: same one I am using

<tomm55> wait a minute
<movl> anyway, a google search on 'git 128' has some valuable info, it seems
<khayyam> jarray52: firewall?
<tomm55> I think the problem is fstack protector  [05:48]
<tomm55> well I need to go I'll explain later
<tomm55> sorry seeya
<khayyam> jarray52: they are saying use git:// rather than https:// ... but it
	  should work either way
<jarray52> khayyam: that actually worked.  [05:49]
<jarray52> hmm...
<khayyam> jarray52: well git:// is the resource locater for git  [05:50]
<jarray52> It's strange. I have a laptop(Ubuntu 10.04 git version 1.7.11.2.249)
	   on which `git clone https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js.git` worked,
	   but it doesn't work on a gentoo box on the same network.  [05:51]
<jarray52> khayyam: That means git:// is the technically correct variant?
<khayyam> jarray52: yes  [05:52]
<khayyam> jarray52: but testing here I can also clone that repo with https://
<jarray52> khayyam: that's odd
<khayyam> jarray52: so, do you hav an account a github and one machine is set to
	  authenticate and the other not  [05:53]
<jarray52> khayyam: That is the case.  [05:54]
<khayyam> jarray52: and likewise here ... so there's your answer

<khayyam> jarray52: of the cause or solution?  [06:19]

<chithead> never install software outside portage, this can break your system
<rizzle> i am thinking of something like i use in freebsd. I am just looking for
	 a light linux system, to mess around with  [06:30]
<rizzle> and portage is always used with  --emerge correct?
<chithead> on gentoo, you install software using the "emerge" command
<jarray52> rizzle: portage is fairly light. not quite make install but close
									  [06:31]
<jarray52> rizzle: light in the sense that it builds the code from source
	   instead of installing binaries
<rizzle> ok so it has the source code in portage, and then builds systems
	 specific packages using emerge form there? does this sound sort of
	 correct?  [06:32]
<jarray52> rizzle: portage is much more robust than freebsd ports. Not as much
	   freedom as the freebsd ports, but not as much pain either.
<rizzle> hmm, ok nice. thanks you guys
<jarray52> rizzle: I believe the source is downloaded.  [06:33]

<khayyam> jarray52: so add 'dev-vcs/git perl -gtk' to /etc/portage/package use
									  [06:49]
<khayyam> jarray52: though I think the +gtk won't be a killer
<khayyam> jarray52: so you could just make that 'dev-vcs/git perl'

<ccherrett> should it read? nano -w /mnt/gentoo/etc/make.conf
<jarray52> khayyam: i used the `.`
<khayyam> ccherrett: yes ... /etc/portage/make.conf is the new location
<Khas> Can I remove entries from the world file manually? Is there any risk
       involved?
<ccherrett> khayyam: what is the new reasoning?
<khayyam> ccherrett: clutter :)  [06:52]
<ccherrett> khayyam: will it still use /etc/make.conf?
<Khas> ccherrett: be very careful not to use /etc/make.conf

<Khas> Nah the ex-binhost.
<khayyam> Khas: I see ... bad break-up I see :)
<Khas> hehe

<jarray52> It's incomprehensible to me.
<jarray52> MPROTECT is all?
<khayyam> jarray52: because it supports using protected memory I thought I'd ask
	  if STACKPROTECTOR was enabled  [07:26]
<annihilator> quick install 2.22
<annihilator> it confuses me
<annihilator> do i need to do that if its dhcp?
<reisio> annihilator: you can skip the first two echo's  [07:28]
<jarray52> annihilator: Are you referring to the lspci and modprobe commands?

<annihilator> cant i just do rc-update add dhcpcd default  [07:30]
<reisio> annihilator: this is essentially why we have the handbook
<khayyam> jarray52: well, the only thing I see there that would raise anykind of
	  clue is 'rmdir("paperclip")' which is called right before it exits
<jarray52> khayyam: Does your strace look identical without the rm?  [07:31]
<khayyam> jarray52: I didn't run strace on that clone
<jarray52> s/rm/rmdir
<khayyam> I see: rmdir("paperclip/.git/hooks") rmdir("paperclip/.git") and
	  rmdir("paperclip")  [07:32]
<jarray52> khayyam: An strace on a working clone would be helpful. I wonder how
	   far things got before my process exited with error code 128.
									  [07:33]
<khayyam> jarray52: well a 'clone' is a clean checkout  [07:35]
<jarray52> right. At some point, your strace would diverge from mine.  [07:36]

<sssilver> nawks: yes, but if I do a APACHE2_MODULES="authz_owner authz_user"

<annihilator> just hope i dont break it
<annihilator> i hate to do it all over again lol
<khayyam> annihilator: -e will only build whats currently installed, the profile

<annihilator> huh?  [08:31]
<marduk> what?
<nawks> sssilver: my guess is that you are going to have to make a list of all

<khayyam> annihilator: you asked "if its completely nescessary if i used desktop
	  profile"
<sssilver> nawks: :1
<sssilver> :(
<annihilator> i know that desktop profile already has certain USE flags already
	      set that is the only reason i asked  [08:33]

<tuxhat> i need to ask a simple question
<khayyam> tuxhat: sure ..  [09:05]
<tuxhat> i have 3 hdd and i want to copy gentoo on one.. how to i see a list of
	 all my drives ?
<tuxhat> so i can know which /dev/[hdd]
<khayyam> tuxhat: in your /etc/fstab generally  [09:06]
<k4tfish> ls /sys/block
<khayyam> tuxhat: on fdisk -l /dev/sdX
<tuxhat> because i have one hdd with debian sid and the on other is a backup and
	 i have this ide 250gb which is where i want to put gentoo
<tuxhat> ok that works  [09:07]
<tuxhat> so u do a fdisk -l /dev/sda or /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc  [09:08]
*** uen| (~uen@p5DCB2B0E.dip.t-dialin.net) is now known as uen
<tuxhat> because i know my debian is a 500gb and my other one is a 500gb which
	 is a backup hdd so my gentoo will be on the 250gb
<khayyam> tuxhat: that will show you the partition layout on those disks yes
<tuxhat> and i can spot it out
<tuxhat> cool thanks man that help me :]  [09:09]
<khayyam> tuxhat: your welcome
<tuxhat> i was gonna put sabayon on but i dont like it all preconfigured i try
	 to hack it its just pointless and they dont got the default gentoo
	 packages  [09:10]
<tuxhat> i just wanted to use it because it sets it up faster
<tuxhat> but ur better off doing it the gentoo way if u want the system in ur
	 full control ;)  [09:11]
<tuxhat> one last question if u don't mind me asking
<khayyam> tuxhat: yes, maybe, but you miss a whole lot of understanding/learning
	  in the process
<tuxhat> i setup gentoo before
<tuxhat> in a vbox that is why i was asking about the drives  [09:12]
<tuxhat> because in vbox is only a sda
<tuxhat> and its in a virtual area.. as to my host i have other internal hdd
	 that i dont want to wipe out or do something stupid like that eh
<tuxhat> is it possible i can do a menu entry with my grub2 on my debian sid
	 grub ?  [09:13]
<tuxhat> for gentoo ?
<khayyam> tuxhat: yes ..
<tuxhat> is it easy
<tuxhat> the last time i setup gentoo i use lilo  [09:14]
<khayyam> tuxhat: well, I don't use grub, so I can't say if its 'easy' or not
<tuxhat> ok khayyam ill do the research thanks for the good answer u said yes it
	 can be done ill do the research i dont want u explaining all this and
	 waste ur time.. thanks for the simple yes ill sort it out.  [09:15]
<khayyam> tuxhat: np ... your welcome
<tuxhat> cheers!
<tuxhat> another thing is when i setup my kernel do i use genkernel
<khayyam> tuxhat: that depends on how familar you are with kernel compilation
									  [09:16]
<khayyam> tuxhat: I've been using gentoo since 2002 and have never used
	  genkernel
<tuxhat> haha i forgot how i done last time i setup base twice so i should get
	 this sorted
<tuxhat> ok i'm doing this in virtualbox and dropping down notes so that when i
	 put it on a host hdd ill know what to do  [09:17]
<tuxhat> one last question .. does emerge have flgrx ?
<tuxhat> or fglrx  [09:18]
<k4tfish> yes flgrx is in portage
<khayyam> tuxhat: emerge? .. I think you mean portage ... yes, flgrx is
	  supported by xorg
<tuxhat> portage eh is that like make install
<tuxhat> like ports in freebsd ?  [09:19]
<k4tfish> yes, its simliar to ports
<tuxhat> where all the ports located ? /etc/ports or /usr/etc/ports ?
<khayyam> tuxhat: 'portage' is like a tree of build descriptions, yes
<khayyam> tuxhat: /usr/portage/
<tuxhat> aaa  [09:20]
<tuxhat> ok
<tuxhat> well i used bsd alot so that should be to hard
<khayyam> tuxhat: but thats no hardcoded
<khayyam> tuxhat: s/no/not
<khayyam> tuxhat: well, its some weekends ahead of ports  [09:21]
<tuxhat> ok thanks
<tuxhat> yeah bsd sucks
<k4tfish> hehe
<tuxhat> gentoo is a nice system indeed
<tuxhat> so now the fun part people
<tuxhat> the cflag
<tuxhat> or whatever its call how can i make compiling faster  [09:22]
<tuxhat> for a amd 64 athlon 4600+
<khayyam> tuxhat: CFLAGS="-O2 -march=native -pipe"
<k4tfish> how many cores?
<tuxhat> 2
<tuxhat> -02 << does that mean 2 cores ?  [09:23]
<k4tfish> ccache helps alot
<tuxhat> what is ccache
<khayyam> tuxhat: no -02 optimization
<khayyam> tuxhat: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Safe_Cflags
<tuxhat> ok thanks
<khayyam> tuxhat: but -march=native is probably the best choice as then the
	  compiler works it out  [09:24]
<tuxhat> cflag basicly compiling for c and c++ like aka gcc
<khayyam> tuxhat: yes, the compiler flags  [09:25]
<tuxhat>  ok thanks  [09:26]
<khayyam> tuxhat: but for SMP/cores there is also the MAKEOPTS= in make.conf
<k4tfish> http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Ccache  [09:27]
<khayyam> tuxhat: this determines the number of -j (jobs) the compiler works on
<k4tfish> http://www.gentoo-wiki.info/HOWTO_Setup_An_ICECREAM_Compile_Cluster
<tuxhat> CHOST="x86_64-pc-linux-gnu"
<tuxhat> CFLAGS="-march=k8 -O2 -pipe"
<tuxhat> CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
<tuxhat> that say for my amd 64 chipset
<k4tfish> looks good  [09:28]
<tuxhat> K8 i guess is what its call
<tuxhat> Athlon 64 X2
<khayyam> tuxhat: just use native ... gcc will figure out the best flags for the
	  compiler

<tuxhat> do u understand what i'm saying ?
<khayyam> tuxhat: awk '/CFLAGS/' /etc/portage/make.conf ... CFLAGS="-O2

<khayyam> Phr33d0m: http://bpaste.net/show/41775/
<tuxhat> how can -j2 be +1
<Phr33d0m> MAKEOPTS= should be cpu-threads +1
<tuxhat> when they say its -j2 ?
<tuxhat> for one core  [10:37]
<khayyam> jerry__: that link leads nowhere
<tuxhat> so MAKEOPTS="+1"
<tuxhat> so leave it at -j2 ?  [10:38]
<khayyam> tuxhat: no, for each of your cores =  1 .. so 4x cores -j4

<khayyam> jerry__: yes, I looked at that when you first posted it  [10:43]
<khayyam> jerry__: what happens when you comment SRC_URI=""?
<khayyam> jerry__: that shouldn't be the issue but I can't see why it wants SVN

<Phr33d0m> jerry__ any special reason you're using boost-1.50 ?
<bigfeng12> Phr33d0m, thanks  [11:15]
<nawks> mingdao: i upgraded to 3.5.2 kernel, and broke my reader.  went through
	an epic set of upgrades, downgrades, upgrades...
<mingdao> nawks: Looks as if the first kernel upgrade on this machine was
	  sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-3.0.4 - 09/24/2011 ... from elogv, but it's
	  an older install than that iirc.
<mingdao> nawks: Same way as mine?  [11:16]
<nawks> yes, same is in, no udev msgs
<mingdao> nawks: Sounds like we've found some regression, then.
<nawks> you get cards if you boot with it
<mingdao> nawks: Which udev are you running?
<nawks> 171
<mingdao> good that
<mingdao> Well, let me kill some sleep time with emerge 3.3.8
<mingdao> was your 3.3.8 *-sources?  [11:17]
<mingdao> My kernels are either kernel.org source of vanilla-sources.
<nawks> they're all gentoo sources
<mingdao> ok, will get that one if it still exists
<nawks> first i tried to boot with old working kernels, still no luck
<khayyam> Phr33d0m: I think we can say that the issue is with
	  metadata-md5-or-flat because other repos with
	  #metadata-md5#metadata-flat#assign get processed  [11:18]
<mingdao> That sounds like latest stable iirc.
<nawks> tried 3.3.8, 3.2.x
<mingdao> Your working 3.3.8 from earlier doesn't anymore?  [11:19]
<nawks> changed linux symlink and rebuilt udev
<Phr33d0m> khayyam I doubt that, it works on all my amd64 servers... I've
	   noticed that the bug reporter and you are running on x86, so a very
	   blind shot - that could be the case, but I doubt it
<Phr33d0m> khayyam a bug report should be sent to the developer
<nawks> nope, but, i think we might have to totally power down to reset card
	reader between tries
<mingdao> khayyam: Again, I haven't followed your issue here, but mntbkr's eix

<khayyam> Phr33d0m: well Vaeth is normally a regular at the forum and I've

<nawks> mingdao: is SND_HDA_GENERIC=y ?
<mingdao> nawks: no, I use the actual chipset and codecs for my cards  [11:41]

	  my "grep Codec /proc/asound/card0/codec#*" output suggests.
	  https://paste.lugons.org/show/IeTNI8xjwMk6WoT5bHnQ/  [11:42]
<mingdao> nawks: I'm sure there is/was some reason.
<nawks> mingdao:  genkernel made it?
<mingdao> nawks: https://paste.lugons.org/show/inqIffcIFWdhxgx14wlX/  [11:43]
<mingdao> nawks: No, I have never used genkernel in my life ... nor will I
	  ever. ;)
<mingdao> nawks: All my kernels are custom built.
<nawks> mingdao: so it works, maybe misses some codec feature.  maybe not
	important if alsa feeds 48k wave data.  [11:45]
<mingdao> nawks: I'm ignorant. If I hear sounds, from multiple things at once,
	  I'm okay.  [11:46]
<nawks> those chips do a poor job of converting 44.1 to 48k in the hardware
<mingdao> nawks: My ears are shot from shooting .45 w/out hearing protection for
	  >20 years.
<nawks> heh  [11:47]
<mingdao> nawks: I'd never know, unfortunately. ;)
<mingdao> nawks: I abhor SND_HDA_INTEL
<DrEeevil> mingdao: your fear of genkernel is amusing
<nawks> you hear pops and dropouts when the codecs have problems
<mingdao> nawks: But the needs on this LAN aren't great for sound, so I just use
	  the onboard trash chips.
<mingdao> DrEeevil: No fear ... just don't care for crapware.
<mingdao> DrEeevil: And there is zero need for help building a kernel. I might
	  not can do much, but that is no problem.  [11:48]
<nawks> mingdao: i got an outboard usb sound box, but i haven't gotten dmix
	working with it :(
<DrEeevil> mingdao: genkernel initramfs <-- learn something new every day
<nawks> does genkernel build all drivers as modules?  [11:49]
<DrEeevil> nawks: the default config does, but you can just override it if you
	   want
<mingdao> DrEeevil: *If* the day comes that an initrd image is required anywhere
	  on this LAN, I'll dig up my old mkinitrd script from Slackware and
	  roll one of them. ;)  [11:50]
<mingdao> DrEeevil: You're had to mess with that for your funky EFI boxen?
<DrEeevil> mingdao: not efi related, just raid + dmcrypt + lvm
<mingdao> DrEeevil: Did you give dracut a whirl? Does it do anything well?
<DrEeevil> mingdao: efi can do some obscene things to itself, it's useless
	   outside of ia64  [11:51]
<DrEeevil> and dracut has no will to live
<DrEeevil> it's a funny game, but I prefer things that work
<mingdao> DrEeevil: Since I see everyone in here making such a hard task of
	  RAID/LVM/LUKS, one day I'm going to resurrect that script and re-write
	  it for Gentoo and make a simple, easy to follow guide for
	  RAID/LVM/LUKS.
<tuxhat> ok for grub i just add title [to whatever], kernel /boot/kernel name
	 root=/dev/sdx3 and initrd /boot/initramfs kernel name and grub-install
<DrEeevil> mingdao: you might want to check the genkernel linuxrc for that (it
	   does exactly that)  [11:52]
<mingdao> nawks: This is the one I have HDMI codecs with: Audio device [0403]:
	  Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RS880 HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 4200
	  Series] [1002:970f]  [11:53]
<DrEeevil> mingdao: but if you want to replace that, genkernel initramfs
	   --linuxrc=/home/mingdao/linuxrc
<mingdao> nawks: In this 3.3.8 build I'm trying Realtek codecs.
<mingdao> just for giggles
<tuxhat> ok i'm gonna install this bitch ... here i go gentoo for the first time
	 on a host.. i done it in vbox 3 times lets see how this puppy works on
	 a host..
<tuxhat> but nobody ask me if that is right  [11:54]
<mingdao> DrEeevil: I don't want an initramfs, just an initrd. And the way it's
	  done in Slackware is so easy to follow, and works so well. I see so
	  many people come here just messing it up all over the place with so
	  many different guides.
<tuxhat> ok for grub i just add title [to whatever], kernel /boot/kernel name
	 root=/dev/sdx3 and initrd /boot/initramfs kernel name and grub-install
<mingdao> DrEeevil: It isn't that complicated.
<mingdao> DrEeevil: So I challenge myself to make an easy guide, and resurrect
	  mkinitrd. ;)
<tuxhat> gah why nobody answers me
<tuxhat> lulz
<mingdao> tuxhat: Watch yore language please.  [11:55]
<tuxhat> im leaving

<tuxhat> sorry aobut the language
<mingdao> tuxhat: Do it and if it breaks, ask.
<mingdao> tuxhat: What have you done so far?
<DrEeevil> mingdao: initramfs is the new initrd
<tuxhat> nothing
<mingdao> DrEeevil: Nothing wrong with the old initrd. ;)
<DrEeevil> mingdao: and genkernel is ...well ... just a little bash scripty
<nawks> mingdao: be sure to set your linux symlink and rebuild udev too
<tuxhat> ok well
<DrEeevil> it doesn't do anything unusual or obscene
<tuxhat> ur right i do have debian on the other hdd

<noc0de> hello all. I've been playing with gentoo for the past week, and I sort
	 of like it. Why all the rumors about gentoo dieing off though? Not sure
	 if thats all in the past now or what?  [12:09]
<meingtsla> Why all the rumors about X dying off, for all values of X?  [12:10]
* noc0de shrugs  [12:11]
<meingtsla> (...not a great choice of variable on my part, but still)
* redcheckers renames noc0de to atlas
<mingdao> The rumors are to keep RedHat devs from showing up in Gentoo channels
	  trying to find out how Openrc works because systemd is burning under
	  their feet.
<DrEeevil> noc0de: gentoo has been claimed to be dying since 2004

	   love child

	      protect if edited default, does that also protect against the

<earendil> ah, my bad
<DrEeevil> earendil: openrc just takes the good ideas and ignores the stupid
<earendil> i like openrc
<noc0de> makes me slightly nervous because stuff like Pear linux, Zorin, and

<mingdao> noc0de: Makes no diff that.
<earendil> i always figured gentoo was dying, but hell if i care. i get mocked

<noc0de> I like being forced to compile my own apps and edit configs... not

	 really! I just throw a -autounmask write in there!
<mingdao> noc0de: ./configure -help ... options = USE flags  [12:23]
<DrEeevil> noc0de: "forced" ? "emerge something" and it'll be installed
<DrEeevil> it's surprisingly boring
<earendil> and easy
<earendil> USE flags > every other management feature i've seen in lunix
<noc0de> DrEeevil: not as boring as using a package manager in gui though!
<noc0de> DrEeevil: I take that back, it probably is just as boring. Although, I

<tuxhat> to save alot of time i'm gonna use the gentoo livedvd and install it
	 the dirty way hehehe  [12:28]
<mingdao> tuxhat: rrrrrrrrrrrrrright
<tuxhat> what ?
<tuxhat> u can install the dvd media on to a hdd  [12:29]
<mingdao> tuxhat: After a few days of doing it your way, waltz on back to The
	  Gentoo Handbook. ;)
<nawks> mingdao: i see i have a lot of special usb hid drivers i don't need  >:
<mingdao> nawks: No worries.
<nawks> don't know how i got those... probably during make .oldconfig
<mingdao> ++smoke test++
<nawks> i'm sure they don't help my usb issues  [12:30]
<tuxhat> why would i go back to the handbook
<tuxhat> i install gentoo the regular way... but all that compiling and
	 generating the kernel and setting up grub its easy to just install it
	 doing the livedvd way it will take about 3 mins  [12:31]
<tuxhat> instead of 5 hours lulz
<khayyam> tuxhat: come back in 3 minutes :)
<tuxhat> why u people so hard on me
<tuxhat> why u want me to do it from scratch  [12:32]
<khayyam> tuxhat: ":)" <= this is "hard"?
<noc0de> doesn't it kind of defeat the purpose?
<noc0de> and won't you spend hours cleaning it up when your done anyways?
<tuxhat> i can do it from scratch its just alot of time
<mingdao> tuxhat: You cannot install any Linux distro in 3 minutes ... period.
<khayyam> tuxhat: and if it'll only take 3 minutes, well then we can wait that
	  long
<tuxhat> i dont got like 6 cores like most of u people do
<mingdao> nawks: Doesn't work with 3.3.8  [12:33]
<tuxhat> lulz im being sarcastic
<tuxhat> but it will not take long compared to doing it from scatch and besides
	 the minimal iso doesnt even work on usb
<mingdao> nawks: SATA still works. I still say it's just USB mass storage.
									  [12:34]
<tuxhat> i done the dd if of
<tuxhat> and it said missing boot loader
<mingdao> nawks: We should have gotten you to "tail -f /var/log/messages" whilst
	  loading a CF card on a working kernel.
<mingdao> nawks: Anyway ... one last reboot to get back to 3.5.2 and moff.
<khayyam> tuxhat: you should use my "blast you way to easy install with my super
	  sex power formula" only 99.99 dullards :)
<tuxhat> well i rather use the livedvd instead of stupid sabayon  [12:35]
<mingdao> tuxhat: SystemRescueCd
<nawks> mingdao: did you do the udev rebuild?
<mingdao> no .. am atm
<tuxhat> well i dont know i dont want to do all those steps i have 5 paper of
	 notes but ill try the livedvd way first
<mingdao> and going to completely power off
<mingdao> just read your suggestions and was doing those
<mingdao> :-)  [12:36]
<tuxhat> and basicly ill probably go back to the gentoo way of installation
* mingdao goes to supply closet to see what card readers are on the shelf

<nawks> how are you going to dial?
<fling> nawks: with /etc/conf.d/net.xyz start ?  [12:52]

<dol-sen> Vinky: any git sources hosted on overlays.gentoo.org have http:

*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v JokerX
<dol-sen> git://git.overlays.gentoo.org/proj/layman.git or
	  https://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitroot/proj/layman.git  [15:52]
<dol-sen> either one will work
<dol-sen> in fact most live ebuilds can timeout on the git url if your behind a
	  firewall and then use the http url instead  [15:53]
<Vinky> Im thinking of prefetching svn sources, well git too but not in this
	specific case  [15:54]
<dol-sen> so set the git remote urls to the http one instead
<dol-sen> Vinky: it could be possible to set up layman with an alternate config
	  to do that for you.  But you need to know how.  [15:57]
<dol-sen> that is a feature I'll add to a gui when I get around to making it
									  [15:58]
<Vinky> dol-sen, and that would allow emerge to prefetch the live sources for
	git as FEATURES=parallel-fetch do for tarballs? Im think we are
	discussing different things
<Vinky> it was DrEeevil talking about git vs http  [15:59]
<dol-sen> well, emerge wouldn't, you would use layman to prefetch like you would
	  sync overlays
<DrEeevil> my idea is to avoid the initial clone :)
<DrEeevil> because that is silly slow
<Vinky> dol-sen, hm that sounds interesting  [16:01]
<DrEeevil> dol-sen: actually I'd extend the git-2 eclass (and others if desired)
									  [16:02]
<Vinky> but would be easier if it were transparent to the user, since it still
	would do the svn up/git pull in the ebuild I guess  [16:03]
<DrEeevil> hmm yes, but it'd still be a nice speedup  [16:04]
<dol-sen> Vinky: with layman-2's api it is quite easy, but layman lacks the
	  native ability to get the info needed from a live ebuild
<dol-sen> which is something a utility script could do relatively easy  [16:05]
* dol-sen goes to bed :O  [16:07]
<Vinky> what makes this more painful is that the upstream server is painfully

<tdr> mastro, ok, i read your paste now.  your mcelog checking cron is omg too
      verbose.  some of that shouldn't be logged (probably) since it's just
      normal conditions.  the exceptions can be a sign a core is bad or memory
      is having problems, though.  [18:44]

      never seen mce log about  [18:45]
<enleth> Does unmerging a package after interrupting (Ctrl+C) a system update
	 prevent from using --resume?  [18:52]
<mastro> tdr, I never know about mcelog until now, so I know less then you,
	 that's why I'm trying to find information on the meaning of those
	 messages, to know if I have an hardware that is failing or if that's
	 some other issue I don't have to be worried about

<crazy_yeti> (from the Cairo ebuild file.  Building Cairo does not require gtk+,

<bpkent> nakee: two successive executions of emerge -avuND world should report

<crazy_yeti> Cyb3r:  OK, I understand what's up now.  The default gentoo config
	     for tor does not enable a unix-domain control socket.  that's why
	     it doesn't show up in lsof or /proc/PID/fd  [21:26]
<crazy_yeti> Cyb3r:  But if you add a ControlSocket directive to torrrc, it
	     works.  You also have to make sure the directory has correct perms
<Cyb3r-Assassin> correct perms as in adding owner of file to the /var/run/tor

<iamben> man, that "safe cflags" article is a mess  [23:08]
<gk> Toothpick: you may want to check your postgresql.conf and /etc/hosts for
     IPv6 addresses or enable them in your kernel/USE  [23:09]
<AwoL> I wonder if that could be a problem if the ipv6 USE is turned on, but
       kernel support is missing

<nawks> mingdao: more weirdness.  when i boot into 3.5.2 the udev and realtek
	don't work right.  but when i start kde they start working.  [23:12]

<Toothpick> gk: i did not enable any flag related to ipv6 and theres nothing in
	    /etc/postgresql-9.1/postgresql.conf related to ipv6  [23:20]
<iamben> Toothpick: USE=ipv6 is on by default in all linux profiles
<Toothpick> oh my  [23:21]
<iamben> except uclibc, that is
<Toothpick> for the first time i need to enable it just for postgresql, is there
	    anything else i could do ?
<iamben> usually it's just fine to have application-level ipv6 support, but have
	 it missing in kernel or on the interfaces... but maybe postgre has a
	 way to explicitly disable ipv6 w/o a rebuild?  [23:22]
<marcus____> http://wklejto.pl/132035  what i did wrong?  [23:32]
<marcus____> oki just wrong things in make.conf cuz its nt usr/portage but
	     usr/share/portage kinda strange  [23:36]
<iamben> marcus____: why did you put the portage tree at /usr/share/portage?
									  [23:48]
<marcus____> i did not it wre there
<marcus____>  when i unpack stage 3
<marcus____> o0
<iamben> marcus____: it won't be there until you unpack a portage snapshot, this
	 is covered in the handbook  [23:50]
<marcus____> o0n i make step by step and nothing aboute unpacking snapshots
<marcus____>  o0
<iamben> what handbook are you following?
<marcus____> o0 it wre i miss it  [23:51]
<marcus____>  damn
<marcus____>  hmm i screw up ?/
<marcus____> or can it be in /usr/share/portage ?
<iamben> it can be, but this is not normal
<marcus____> ok can i move it after sync ?  [23:52]
<marcus____>  to usr/portage  wwith rsync?
<iamben> you probably still have your snapshot, right?
<iamben> just unpack it again, at the proper location
<marcus____> oki
<marcus____> and change to defaults makeconf?  [23:53]
<iamben> well, just remove/comment your PORTDIR setting  [23:55]
<marcus____> kk
<marcus____>  btw the catalog /usr/share/portage wre empty ? on  begining?
<iamben> yes, that should be empty on a fresh install  [23:56]
<marcus____> oki so i just mv it i got already updated will be faster
<iamben> actually the make.globals and sets items in that dir should have
	 existed, & need to stay  [23:59]

*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v dabbott
									  [00:17]
<roravun> Hello.  [00:19]
<khayyam> roravun: hey  [00:20]
<roravun> Is there a standard way to use different wpa_supplicant.conf s for
	  each particular case?
<khayyam> roravun: yes, use the '-c' switch
<roravun> nah  [00:21]
<roravun> I meant by use of gentoo's services
<iamben> for each "case" of what?
<roravun> you can be sure i ve read man :_)
<roravun> iamben: for instance, at home I might want to connect to mf home
	  router.
<khayyam> roravun: well, some 'services' are not called wpa_supplicant  [00:22]
<roravun> But from time to time I would like to start ad-hoc network
<roravun> *my
<iamben> your config allows many different networks to be specified  [00:23]
<roravun> Now I just run /etc/init.d/wlan0 stop, then enter wpa_supplicant with
	  appropiate '-c'.
<khayyam> roravun: s/called/calling/
<roravun> iamben: There is no way wpa_supplicant will now that I want to run
	  ad-hoc instead of regural wpa connection.  [00:24]
<khayyam> roravun: have you looked at the 'SSID' and 'BSSID' in
	  /usr/share/doc/openrc-<version>/net.example.bz2?
<roravun> khayyam: I try to find 'BSSID' in this file but search fails.  [00:25]
<khayyam> roravun: well they are actuall BSSID's ... also look at mode_${IFACE}
									  [00:26]
<khayyam> roravun: eg: mac_key_001122334455  [00:27]
<roravun> khayyam: I know  the basics of net configuration in gentoo. I just
	  wanted to know if there is already a convinient way to handle multiple
	  configurations per interface via use of services.  [00:28]
<Ziggy`> How can I order with top what's using my RAM most?  [00:30]
<Ziggy`> forgot :>
<roravun> khayyam:for example '/etc/init.d/net.wlan0-adhoc start' would start
	  wpa_supplicant with appropiate conf, and
	  '/etc/init.d/net.wlan0-regural' would use a different file. But I
	  guess I will have to write the scripts :)
<K_F> Ziggy`: shift+M ?
<K_F> guess that is just "M"..  [00:31]
<nawks> roravun: you could look at how net.eth0 net.eth1 symlink to net.lo
<roravun> yeah  [00:32]
<roravun> nawks: but they are real ifaces, no?
<roravun> nawks: or you mean to reuse this mechanism to achieve what i want?
<nawks> yes, reuse that method  [00:33]
<Ziggy`> K_F: Thanks, can always also just use htop
<Ziggy`> Can't seem to output though in a easy way what's eating upp my ram
									  [00:34]
<khayyam> roravun: you can also use wpa_supplicant's 'control_interface'
	  ... mode= can be within a network block
<nawks> roravun: see how there is only conf.d/net used, but it has entries for
	multiple interfaces config_<if>  [00:35]
<Ziggy`> I've noticed all my ram, and swap has been eaten.
<roravun> Ziggy`: And who's the hog?  [00:39]
<roravun> khayyam,nawks: Thanks for your help.  [00:42]
<khayyam> roravun: np .. your welcome  [00:43]
<khayyam> roravun: I'd like to see what you come up with  [00:44]
<roravun> khayyam: kay, when I'm done I can share the solution. See ya :)
<g33kN> If I try and contact my ISP about IP abuse am I likely to do any good?
	Or just wrap myself into a supspicful watch?  [00:47]
<Ziggy`> so I set up cron on my machine yesterday, I was migrating some cronjobs
	 from one machine to another yesterday. Today, when I connected to the
	 machine, I noticed all the ram the machine had, had been eaten up, when
	 I run htop or top, and look at usage, It shows as if there are tons of
	 instances currently running, php, sendmail and so on. On the other
	 machine however, these cronjobs run fine.  [00:51]
<Ziggy`> Any suggestions to what could be going wrong here?
<g33kN> hahhah, sorry wrong chan  [00:54]
<khayyam> Ziggy`: check the fields in the crontab entry ...  [00:58]
<Ziggy`> khayyam: Where?  [01:05]
<khayyam> Ziggy`: crontab -l  [01:07]
<Ziggy`> Yeah, it's all correct. It's the same as it is on the other machine
<Ziggy`> I'm suspecting it has to do with postfix, On the new machine it has
	 setup the domain that is on the other machine, but I haven't moved the
	 DNS.  [01:08]
<Ziggy`> I removed the daily sending mail cronjob, and rebooted, and it seems it
	 aint eating up ram anymore.
<khayyam> Ziggy`: I've seen something similar in the past when the admin had
	  made a typo in the fields  [01:09]
<marcus> can libre run on qt only system without any gtk libs?  [01:12]
<marcus> libre office
<violetina> marcus: yes but last time that did not render fonts fine for me
<violetina> AA seemed to not work  [01:13]
<marcus> ok i jsut hate gtk and want make this laptop gtk free
<violetina> but that is like 3 months ago so no idea how it is now
<verty_> marcus: why is that?  [01:15]
<marcus> cuz gt is hog and looks awfull and always my kde themes got screwed
	 over by unmatching gtk crap  [01:16]
<marcus> and i jsut want make this la fast as posible
<mingdao> marcus: Got a SSD?
<marcus> and simply cuz i im who i am and i dont like things id ont like if u
	 know what i mean
<marcus>  not on laptop
<mmcji> I have a legacy production Gentoo system, /etc/gentoo-release says
	"Gentoo Base System version 1.6.12."  It has a 2.4.31 kernel.  The box
	has to remain online and can't have it's os upgraded however I need to
	install amanda on it.  when I do emerge --pretend amanda I see "Your
	current profile is deprecated and not supported anymore."  1st question,
	does this mean portage will no longer be able to pull down the necessary
	files needed to install amanda or does i
<mmcji> t mean, no gentoo support is available any longer.  I mostly work with
	RPM and DPKG based systems so I know very little about gentoo and
	portage.
<verty_> marcus: I didn't think gtk is a hog, is all  [01:17]
<mingdao> marcus: They are PCs ... *P* ersonal *C* computer ... have it your way
	  ;)
*** kripton (kripton-fr@staff.kripserver.net) is now known as Kripton
<ASnyder1> Hey guys, another really silly question. If I wanted to "cd" into a
	   directory in an init script, how would I chain the two commands? For
	   example "exec cd /some/other/dir; /path/to/some/script -- -opt1 -opt2
	   ?
<verty_> marcus: I mean, I thought it ran quite quick
<mingdao> mmcji: It means you can't upgrade any software through portage.
									  [01:18]
<verty_> mmcji: gentoo may not be for you, most people upgrade all the time
<verty_> mmcji: the idea is to stay uptodate always
<khayyam> mmcji: becuase gentoo is a rolling release it requires that updates
	  are rolled in on a fairly regular basis
<mingdao> mmcji: You can setup a personal overlay and make ebuilds for there, or
	  just the old "./configure && make && make install" ... which is
	  probably not very efficient.
<mingdao> mmcji: Best get a backup plan for the data and decide what OS to use
	  on this machine that you can maintain in the future.  [01:19]
<marcus> yeah maybe but i jsut prfer kde so i want got clean system without any
	 unnesesary things like gtk  [01:20]
<khayyam> ASnyder1: why 'cd' you can stipulate the full path to executable
	  ... also 'exec cd' will 'exit' once that command has completed
<K_F> mmcji: if you are careful about it, you should be able to switch to a
      different profile without breaking too much stuff, see eselect profile
      list  [01:22]
<verty_> ASnyder1: I think you would need to create a separate script to exec.
	 You may not need the exec though
<mmcji> verty_: it is an old production box that predates me at the company I
	work at by many years.  It was a one off build.  We keep all other
	systems fully updated.  This was a one off someone built years ago, then
	that person moved on.  I agree with what you are saying completely.
<K_F> mmcji: but 2.4 sounds even more legacy than one of my legacy 2.6.15
      servers...
<K_F> remote server stashed in a colo so I don't dare upgrading the kernel on
      it, or udev, as that'd break the box, but all the other packages works
      surprisingly well  [01:23]
<K_F> so I just put the appropriate masks in myself
<mingdao> mmcji: Your 2.4.31 was last updated 06/01/2005? You're vulnerable all
	  over the place there.  [01:24]
<mmcji> i would normally define upgrades and new package installs as two
	different things, but you are saying they are the same thing in this
	case.  Sounds like I need to compile from source then.
<mmcji> The box is scheduled to be replaced, but no date has been set yet.
<mingdao> mmcji: It's just that there's not any software left in the Gentoo
	  overlay for that system you have.  [01:25]
<mmcji> ah ok
<alazred> Hi guys, I get this error http://dpaste.com/791075/ when I try to
	  launch aegisub on my gentoo box. Any idea ?
<mingdao> mmcji: Both upgrades and new installed software have requirements way
	  past that installation.
<mmcji> mingdao: thank you
<mmcji> K_F:thank you
<mmcji> verty_:thank you  [01:26]
<K_F> mmcji: if you do switch the profile, remember to look at the -pv output
      very carefully before letting any emerge happen
<K_F> and do stuff more on a package-by-package basis than you normally would
									  [01:27]
<khayyam> alazred: difficult to tell from that error, a library mis-match
	  perhaps, perhaps mesa was updated?
<verty_> mmcji: ok, no worries.  If you ever do decide to upgrade the system, it
	 may be prohibitively difficult because of things depending on each
	 other, probably easier to reinstall but keep the list of installed
	 packages, quite technical but we can help if you need to do that
<alazred> khayyam: I just made a fresh install.  [01:28]
<mmcji> thanks
<khayyam> alazred: see:
	  http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glXChooseFBConfig.xml "if an
	  error occurs, no frame buffer configurations exist on the specified
	  screen  [01:31]
<alazred> khayyam: I'll thake a look at that !  [01:32]
<anxt> so do i need to make a new initrd to boot a new 3.4 kernel?L  [01:33]
<ASnyder1> khayyam: for some odd reason when the script is executed outside of
	   the directory, odd things happen.  [01:34]
<K_F> anxt: well, depending on the kernel and system config you don't
      necessarily *need* an initrd, but I'm tempted to say yes
<marcus> i got question when i set default profile /amd64 destop kde how to
	 check what flags will be used so i dont need to run true all flags
									  [01:35]
<anxt> K_F: oh i NEED one, thanks to udev
<ASnyder1> verty_: Thanks, I'll see what I can do.
<anxt> K_F: is there actually stuff in the initrd that depends a particular
       kernel version?  [01:36]
<khayyam> ASnyder1: probably as the script is coded to look in "." for data or
	  what have you
<K_F> anxt: depends on module ABI
<anxt> K_F: ahh, that makes sense.
<K_F> quicker to just create a new one upon kernel upgrade than worry abou it
									  [01:37]
<anxt> application binary interface, right?
<anxt> K_F: will do
<K_F> binary interface indeed, as opposed to programming interface..
<anxt> wow make -j9 builds me a kernel in like 60 seconds or something
<K_F> anxt: code vs dynamic linking
<anxt> K_F: i am unclear on a lot of the details of syscalls, and binary
       loading, symbol tables, etc.  [01:38]
<Vinky> anxt, if you dont have modules I doubt it will be kernel version
	dependant
<anxt> K_F: something i will remedy after i take my next 8 math classes.
<anxt> Vinky: no modules necessary to bootstrap, anyways.  my xorg drive is a
       KLD  [01:39]

<Vinky> a what?
*** Exio (exio4@trekweb/user/ex) is now known as Exio_

<anxt> khayyam: no ccache either

<khayyam> anxt: if you run a task, then rerun that same task its in memory
<anxt> khayyam: sort of true.  thats what i meant when i said incore.  [01:46]
<verty_> cached  [01:47]
<khayyam> verty_: exactly
<anxt> sort of

<crazy_yeti> Smiley:  "-t sec", see?  "sec" is a number of seconds
<annihilator> just copy and past
<Smiley> shutdown -r 5 gave me "shutdown in 5 minutes"
<Smiley> crazy_yeti: yes
<Smiley> read the nmessage
<Smiley> it says "try now".
<crazy_yeti> ok, man says:
<Smiley> So I tried both 5, and now. Both didn't work.
<anxt> ok system is cold

<annihilator> did you just type reboot
<crazy_yeti> -t sec Tell init(8) to wait sec seconds between sending processes
	     the  warning and the kill signal, before changing to another
	     runlevel.
<Smiley> Lets hope this time it ACTUALLY reboots.
<crazy_yeti> Smiley:  the "-t" field is not shutdown time, it's a grace period,
	     in seconds, between the TERM and KILL signals sent to processes
<Smiley> ah
<Smiley> hmmm
<crazy_yeti> Smiley:  so you still need to specify WHEN to do the reboot
*** robink_ (~quassel@fatcat.creosotehill.org) is now known as robink
<Smiley> so it'd be -t 5 5 ;)
<Vinky> crazy_yeti, it also says: the word now is an alias for +0  [01:52]
<crazy_yeti> also, as you see:  for the "-t" flag it is seconds, but the "time"
	     field is in mins
<annihilator> lol
<Smiley> hmmmm has a minute passed yet ¬_¬; I'm still here and its my router....
<crazy_yeti> Vinky:  Yes, indeed, as I said "just say now" :-)
<anxt> i reboot with init 6

<annihilator> lol
<anxt> i cowboy up.
<crazy_yeti> Bye Smiley!
<Smiley> Hmmm, I'm still here :<

<anxt> khayyam, verty_ upon a complete reboot "real	2m5.555s"
<anxt> seems it didnt really make a significant difference, in my case.  [01:55]
<verty_> anxt: what is that?
<anxt> the compile time, w/o the kernel having every touched the source tree
       yet.
<verty_> anxt: what are you trying to do?
<Smiley> uhoh  [01:56]
<annihilator> ?
<anxt> oh, khayyam was suggesting my results were poor because my .c files may
       be in kernel cache
<anxt> nm
<verty_> anxt: I don't know if it is poor or not.  I don't know what is
	 compiling or what machine it is
<verty_> anxt: I'll read the conversion above :)  [01:57]
<anxt> i was just looking at whether my timing results were skewed on my
       machine, having already compiled, claiming a make clean would be pretty
       much the same
<anxt> i still have 7 gigs of ram free, maybe i should start firefox  [01:58]
<crazy_yeti> Smiley:  what happened?

<crazy_yeti> anxt: good stuff to know if you are doing any sort of benchmarking.
	     this way you can make sure all caches are flushed out before you
	     start any benchmarks
<anxt> crazy_yeti: i need something like that for freebsd  [02:04]
<crazy_yeti> there is so  much stuff in /proc/sys, if you know how to use the
	     tools provided there, then you are a real linux "power user", IMO
<verty_> crazy_yeti: I just run the benchmark 4 times, so the times settle
<crazy_yeti> verty: they settle, probably because input data is cached  [02:05]
<verty_> crazy_yeti: that's the idea
<crazy_yeti> verty:  depends on what you are benchmarking i guess!  if it's a
	     pure CPU benchmark vs one that includes I/O  [02:06]
<crazy_yeti> verty:  sorry, i did not follow the entire conversation, came in in

	 put it in portage
<gentoo_ne> oh ok
<gentoo_ne> i think that /etc/make.conf is better  [02:09]
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v nik0
<Rudolf> how can i avoid to show my openssh version with a simple telnet test?
<verty_> gentoo_ne: I guess it also helps if you reinstall, stuff is collected
	 together in /etc/portage
<gentoo_ne> verty_: is there a minimal gentoo profile?  [02:12]
<gentoo_ne> i dont want the all the desktop flag i just want the minimal
<verty_> gentoo_ne: I don't actually know, but let me look  [02:14]
<mrueg> gentoo_ne: just use the server profile
<verty_> my english is poor today :)
<gentoo_ne> like installing xorg would downloading me like cups and what not
<gentoo_ne> but i dont really care for cups
<verty_> gentoo_ne: I also think the server profile would be the best option
									  [02:16]
<gentoo_ne> ok thanks
<verty_> gentoo_ne: cups is annoying, just icedtea needs it regardless so I've
	 given up the fight
<anxt> cups is apple trying to get onto our boxes  [02:17]
<gentoo_ne> i want archlinux minimal packages
<anxt> as a total freetard, i choose to use lpd, not cups.
<verty_> gentoo_ne: perhaps you can just mask whatever is in the server profile
	 that you don't want  [02:18]
<gentoo_ne> yes i will have to do that. but that is a bit time consuming
<earendil> grrr cups  [02:20]
<earendil> i specifically have always put a global USE of -cups, and i've been
	   forced to use it now. i'm still bitter
<anxt> well why would you not want cups and samba, its like love and mariage
<khayyam> gentoo_ne: you don't really need to link to an actual profile .. my
	  profile: /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/x86/10.0/  [02:21]
<anxt> i dunno why gentoo emacs insists on a graphcial toolkit to build emacs
       with X org support.
<LokiChaos> I'd rather have cups than dbus  [02:22]
<anxt> id rather go fishing with bush than hunting with cheney

<nawks> mingdao: and it doesn't work under flux right?
<Novarg> anyone have an idea why my screen keeps dimming when I plug in/out the
	 ac adapter? happens with killed gnome-power-manager too. what else
	 controls backlight?  [02:26]
<mingdao> nawks: If the CF card and SD card are plugged in when I boot, they're
	  detected. But one removed, they're gone (3.5.2 or the 3.3.8).
<anxt> Novarg: acpid?
<anxt> Novarg: laptop-mode-utils?
<Novarg> anxt: worth a shot, I'll kill and try
<mingdao> Novarg: BIOS setting?
<Novarg> it's not happening under dual-booted windows
<nawks> mingdao: if you boot with them in, then pull them out, they don't
	disappear from /dev/ do they?
<Novarg> and yes, I had laptop-mode-utils installed at some point and am since
	 trying to get rid of it. I keep finding remaining files every now and
	 then  [02:27]
<mingdao> Novarg: Windows has power settings; some Linux environments do, also.
<marcus> damn i cannto emerge anything
<marcus> http://pastebin.com/9eue334w
<marcus>  i try emerge kernel and buuu  this gentoo dont like me
<nawks> mingdao: does udisks run when you startx?
<anxt> it would be cool if you could set like a kernel breakpoint for when the
       syscall happened
<Novarg> anxt: stopped acpid service, no difference  [02:28]
<mingdao> nawks: I only checked blkid for the devices.
<khayyam> marcus: generally that error denotes bad CFLAGS
<anxt> Novarg: udev?
<verty_> Novarg: I think that is built in  behaviour in most laptops
<Novarg> mingdao: well basically, gnome does have some power settings, though I
	 imagined they all rely on the gnome-power-manager
<mingdao> nawks: I don't install udisks for Fluxbox.
<marcus> i got cflags from gentoo guide fro my cpu

<mingdao> verty_: Why not?
<ghs> I already I did of all!  Already compiled udf on my kernel, and not it

<marcus> now its working
<marcus>  xd Thanx  [02:34]
<khayyam> marcus: np ..
<verty_> marcus, omit frame pointer is default since gcc 4.6, so you may not
	 need it
<mingdao> nawks: For the time being I'm through fooling with it. Whenever I get
	  to a stopping point in work, I'm going to add that Sabrent reader and
	  see if CF and SD work in it. If so, I'll keep both it (for
	  CF/SD/MicroSD) and the Rosewill (for SATA).
<mingdao> marcus: You're not stupid ... just ignorant.  [02:35]
<marcus> nah im blind xd
<mingdao> marcus: Ignorance is lack of knowledge ... but add knowledge and you

<mingdao> My frame pointers all blew out.  [02:36]
<marcus> mingdao:  i understood  but the problem is not lack of knolwedge but -

<mingdao> marcus: The Gentoo Handbook is pretty safe to copy/paste; then you can

<mingdao> marcus: But other "gentoo guides" -- use at your own risk.  [02:37]

<marcus> the tuxonice kernel is good for laptop ?  [02:40]
<mingdao> very much so
<marcus> oki thanx  [02:41]
<TitanOfOld> I really need to give tuxonice a go. I'm just having a really
	     difficult time letting go of these hardened features.
<mingdao> We're using sys-kernel/tuxonice-sources-3.4.5 on two ThinkPads here
	  with good results.
<Novarg> why is it better? as far as I can tell from the page, all it adds is
	 hibernate functionality
<khayyam> marcus: but there are other kernel sources with more recent tuxonice
	  patches
<marcus> hmm ?  [02:42]
<mingdao> khayyam: In portage?
<undrwater> just ran into some firmware trouble with tuxonice on a thinkpad
<mingdao> undrwater: Details?  [02:43]
<khayyam> marcus: I believe tuxonice-sources are 3.0.17
<TitanOfOld> undrwater: What kind of firmware trouble?
<undrwater> mingdao: still working on it...but it's the iwlwifi ucode
<marcus> 3.4
<TitanOfOld> khayyam: Ahem: < mingdao> We're using
	     sys-kernel/tuxonice-sources-3.4.5
<undrwater> mingdao: 6050
<khayyam> mingdao: no, not necessarily in portage
<khayyam> TitanOfOld: I see ...
<mingdao> undrwater: http://bpaste.net/show/41879/  [02:44]
<TitanOfOld> khayyam: 3.4.5 hasn't been stabled, yet. But they are there.
<mingdao> khayyam: If it's not in portage, for me, it's from kernel.org and
	  built in ~/kernel/
<undrwater> mingdao: did you get firmware from portage? if so, which package?
									  [02:45]
<mingdao> 3.0.17-r1 is latest amd64, but I've been running 3.4.5 on these two
	  since July 21 with no (known) issues.
<khayyam> mingdao: well, pf-sources has tuxonice
<TitanOfOld> undrwater: I always go with linux-firmware
<TitanOfOld> But that's because I use radeon and I need something for the
	     wifi. I don't think it's iwlwifi.  [02:46]
<khayyam> TitanOfOld: yes, I'd just assumed that a new user would emerge without
	  accept_keywords
<mingdao> undrwater: Yes ... sys-firmware/iwl6005-ucode-17.168.5.3
<mingdao> bbl
<undrwater> TitanOfOld: that's my next step...
<undrwater> mingdao: yeah...that's different than mine  [02:47]
<iamben> undrwater: maybe you can tell us what the exact issue, maybe someone
	 has seen the error but does not have your exact same kernel & hardware
									  [02:48]
<undrwater> iamben: the exact issue is kernel reports: request for firmware file
	    iwlwifi-6050-5.ucode failed  [02:50]
<undrwater> and i don't have a wlan at boot
<tdr>  Novarg hibernate works perfectly fine on my thinkpad using
      vanilla-sources or gentoo-sources, too.
<iamben> undrwater: and you have sys-firmware/iwl6050-ucode-41.28.5.1 from
	 portage, right?  [02:51]
<undrwater> iamben: it has been reported that linux-firmware works, while
	    iwl6050-ucode does not
<marcus> is ther a python3 package ?  [02:52]
<undrwater> iamben: yes, i tried both 41. and 9.
<iamben> marcus: there is a python package which has 2.x and 3.x versions
<TitanOfOld> marcus: Yes, it's probably already installed.
<freakynl> hi, any issues known with kde and pulse? logging into kde takes a
	   long time, during which icons and start menu etc. are frozen. they
	   *always* release/start working on playing the intro tune which leads
	   me to believe it hangs on that
<marcus> not rly  [02:53]
<marcus>  merging it
<iamben> undrwater: have you tried that linux-firmware yet? as far as i can
	 tell, upstream (intel) has only ever released those 2 versions of the
	 ucode, so linux-firmware should be using one or othe other
<iamben> marcus: from a fresh install, python-3.2 is already installed  [02:54]
<Khas> Is anyone here using pglinux and named on the same server?
<tdr> freakynl, the intro music just loads after a lot of other stuff, its
      probably not sound being hung
<marcus> hmm strange cuz i make emerge python and it pulls 3.2 with deps
<tdr> marcus, emerge python:2.7
<undrwater> iamben: just emerged linux-firmware...will let you know in a sec
									  [02:55]
<tdr> marcinkuzminski_, the :2.7 is a slot, there are 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2
      slots
<tdr> marcus ^^
<iamben> marcus: how is that strange?
<iamben> "emerge python" will try to install the latest available
<tester> quick question do i use core2 or generic-x86-64 in the kernel config
	 for a core i7  [02:56]
<tester> python 2 and 3 are differant i believe some of the gentoo tools them
	 self use 2 so you need both
<marcus> hmm   or emerge it wwith my use flasg oh right my bad
<undrwater> iamben: no...that failed as well...is there a place in the kernel
	    config to specify firmware location?  [02:57]
<khayyam> tester: core2 .. "Intel Core 2 and newer"  [02:59]
<TitanOfOld> undrwater:
<TitanOfOld> undrwater: Yes, there is.
<khayyam> undrwater: EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR  [03:00]
<TitanOfOld> undrwater: Device Drivers -> Generic Driver Options
<iamben> i thought that firmware dir option was just for built-in blobs, not for
	 module load-time firmware loads from rootfs
<khayyam> iamben: your correct ..  [03:02]
<tester> thanks khayyam
<iamben> undrwater: is iwlwifi built-in or modular?
<khayyam> tester: your welcome
<undrwater> TitanOfOld: is it the "External firmware blobs to build into the
	    kernel binary"?  [03:04]
<undrwater> hrm
<nawks> how dangerous is the udev 188 upgrade?  pciutils and usbutils are
	blocking required hwids  [03:05]
<iamben> nawks: the dangers of a udev upgrade arent' really related to the
	 pciutils/usbutils blockers
<khayyam> undrwater: it is, but as iamben is pointing out you only need this
	  build firmware in the kernel, loading from the HD should work non the
	  less  [03:06]
<nawks> also openrc shows as blocking udev-188
<iamben> those blockers are happening because the old pciutils/usbutils pacakges
	 provided the hwdb's themselves, now it's a separate pacakge
<iamben> nawks: the issue is, all these thigns must be upgraded at the same
	 time.  you can't mix/match old/new here
<nawks> iamben: there is no higher version of usbutils though  [03:07]
<iamben> nawks: don't ignore the < sign
<iamben> less than that particular version, is what's blocking.  that version
	 itself is what you WANT
<nawks> oh yeh :)
<nawks> eix usbutils
<LokiChaos> any have experince with UEFI + GRUB2?  I have grub2 booting, it
	    loads the kernel and initramfs, but the kernel doesn't seem to boot.
	    I've tried a manually configured kernel and genkernel  [03:08]
<iamben> LokiChaos: does it give an error?
<LokiChaos> no, it just gives the 2 lines about loading the kernel and initramfs
	    and nothing  [03:09]
<nawks> iamben: so uh, what ARE the dangers of a udev upgrade (:.
<nawks> i don't have a tmp usr or var dir  [03:10]
<nawks> i mean tmpfs usr or var
<iamben> nawks: watch for warnings @ update time, there is an extra kernel
	 option or 2 that is *required*, that will cause udev to fail if you are
	 missing them

<mingdao> undrwater: Thanks, I just misread the number.  [03:26]
<mingdao> undrwater: Didn't want to be that_far_behind on some firmware. ;)
<undrwater> i've set debug on iwlwifi...kernel still not finding the firmware
									  [03:27]
<mingdao> undrwater: dmesg | grep firmware    give any hints?
<undrwater> mingdao: yes, that it's not found ;)  [03:28]
<khayyam> mingdao: the eix bug has been tracked down, and it did only hit x86
	  .. the fix is fairly simple, and there will be an update over the
	  weekend
<iamben> undrwater: is iwlwifi built-in or module?  [03:29]
<undrwater> mingdao: not since setting debug tho...booting now
<undrwater> iamben: built-in
<undrwater> iamben: i will try as module next
<mingdao> khayyam: I thought as much ... haven't run an x86 arch system since
	  migrating to Gentoo.  [03:30]
<mingdao> undrwater: I have some firmware that quit working as built-in and
	  requires as module to load ... was just looking for which that is...
<iamben> undrwater: some modules require the firmware to be present right when
	 the driver is loaded, in which case you would need the firmware built
	 into the kernel bzimage itself.  my intel 5300 + iwl5000-ucode doesn't
	 load it until later, but yours may be different
<undrwater> iamben: it is built in currently...but i will try as module if
	    nothing else  [03:31]
<iamben> you can verify this by looking at the timestamp on dmesg's firmware
	 load error, if it's within the first few seconds of the kernel load, it
	 will need to be built into the kernel (or just modularize iwiwifi)
<iamben> module should be safe & easy in any case
<pippo> ciao  [03:32]
<pippo> !list
<iamben> it's probably best practice to just use modules on any firmware-loading
	 driver, but i'm spoiled and my setup doesn't require it
<undrwater> weird...turning on debug actually got it working :|

<annihilator> but i know part of the problem but what do i put for kernel
<annihilator> just do /boot/bzImage?
<nawks> iamben: when card reader is empty the sd card slot is /dev/sde.  when
	you plug in the sd card that should become /dev/sde1.  should udev
	detect that event and create /dev/sde1 on its own?
<annihilator> if its setup to automount then yes  [03:41]
<tester> annihilator, might be better to give it a name like
	 gentoo-sources-version
<nawks> annihilator: automount is a udisk function
<iamben> nawks: can you see if any extra modules are loaded after udisks starst
	 up?
<annihilator> kernel /boot/kernel-genkernel-x86-2.6.24-gentoo-r5 root=/dev/ram0

<iamben> nawks: see if doing "partprobe" after plugging it in helps  [03:43]
<iamben> not that this is a FIX, but im just curious what udev ISN'T doing on

<annihilator> its not in stable  [03:44]

<Khas> I stick with stable as much as possible these days :-)

	 swap?
<annihilator> well 3.5.2 offers more function for my laptop Khas
<nawks> iamben: ok i just killed udisks-daemon.  it stopped recognizing card
	removal/insertion again after that.  now try partprobe  [03:45]
<Khas> annihilator: ooh, like what?  I have a laptop
<annihilator> my main function is the touchpad
<khayyam> tester: yes ... but its often a good idea to have swap regardless of

<annihilator> that allong with the xorg synaptics driver i have no issues
<khayyam> Khas: /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf
<iamben> Khas: if you enable synaptics in INPUT_DEVICES, you should have a file
	 /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf that you can copy to
	 /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and add tweaks/options
<alazred> khayyam: I updated it I'll see if it does something.
<annihilator> khas does not have 3.5.2  [03:47]
<annihilator> so it may not fully function right
<khayyam> Khas: or rather the eq in /etc/X11 (which overides) ...
<iamben> annihilator: umm synaptics is not new to 3.5.2, maybe one specific
	 hardware type is added though
<tester> khayyam, yea i got it setup on a hard drive just cant remember where,
	 gonna have to share with xbun
<annihilator> iamben: ps2 (most common) is new to 3.5.2
<Khas> annihilator: it should do, it worked years ago.
<khayyam> Khas: you should also look at the synaptics/alps page on the wiki
<iamben> annihilator: it most certainly is not =)
<Khas> I'm reading it now :-)
<TitanOfOld> mingdao: Do the laptops sleep/wake up as they should?
<annihilator> uh look at the kernel...
<annihilator> 3.3.8 does not offer function for my laptop  [03:48]
<nawks> iamben: executing partprobe /dev/sde after removing sd card removes
	/dev/sde1.  exec after inserting card adds /dev/sde1
<iamben> annihilator: for YOUR specific touchpad, maybe.  people have been using
	 ps2 synaptics for years and years.
<mingdao> TitanOfOld: yes
<TitanOfOld> mingdao: To be very specific, sleep and not hibernate.  [03:49]
<annihilator> ....we can just argue about that but as touchpads get more sensors
	      the kernel does not always fully function right
<annihilator> that has been that way since rh6
<iamben> annihilator: you were implying that synaptics was not available until
	 3.5
<mingdao> TitanOfOld: I only use "pm-suspend" on my laptops.  [03:50]
<annihilator> ...i said ps2
<annihilator> there is two pertiticular type of synaptic connections
<iamben> annihilator: i've been using a ps2 synaptics touchpad for almost 5
	 years now
<mingdao> TitanOfOld: I wouldn't know HOW-TO sleep them, I don't guess.
<mingdao> iamben: Since '03 for me.
<annihilator> iamben: all your going to do is speen wheels cause for as long as
	      i have been on linux i had to rely on xorg driver  [03:51]
<Khas> iamben: me too :-D
<mingdao> First laptop I killed with a Linux OS had synaptics touchpad ... Sony
	  beast.
<iamben> nawks: do you have any stale rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/ , or other
	 udev files that needs updating?
<Khas> That's why I know I can do two finger scrolling and stuff :-)
<nawks> iamben: 70-persisten-cd.rules from jul 24  [03:52]
<TitanOfOld> mingdao: Well, I'm going to give this a go. This laptop is still
	     only capable of going to sleep. The video just never wakes up.
<iamben> annihilator: there is a kernel component and an xorg component  [03:53]
<iamben> nawks: see if "emerge -1 --noconfmem udev && dispatch-conf" has any
	 configs to update
<iamben> also watch for emerge warnings, for possible missing kernel config
	 options
<nawks> iamben: running now.  udev usb plug and play works great.  it's
	something about this card reader working with scsi LUNs.  it's not a new
	usb device when card is plugged in, just a new sub-interface.  don't
	know if udev is responsible for recognizing that and creating /dev/sde1
	or not  [03:58]
<nawks> iamben: which option in dispatch-conf to look at changes before i
	accept/overwrite?
<iamben> multi-lun is probably involved, but it's either on or off, i dont know
	 how udisks would work any different
<tester> what one can i make look nicer grub or lilo?  [03:59]
<nawks> iamben: udisks polls, settable interval
<iamben> nawks: the diff/changes is what's shown automatically
<tester> grub is easier n/m
<iamben> nawks: yeah but i meant if multi-lun was off, the interval polling
	 would still not work
<nawks> iamben: i've had multi-lun in kernels always  [04:00]
<iamben> i figured, otherwise udisks would not work either
<nawks> only change was in udev.conf. wanted to remove "debug" opt  [04:02]
<nawks> iamben: the 4 LUNs are actually enumerated as usb if0/sdc, if1/sdd,
	if2/sde, if4/sdf.  so now i'm thinking there isn't any new device msg to
	udev from inserting card.  it's a new partition not a new device. yes?
									  [04:05]
*** garrett__ (~garrett@173.217.237.239) is now known as NybbleNybble
<nawks> iamben: if i create a new partition on an hdd, udev isn't going to see
	that automagically.  [04:07]
<iamben> not sure how that is handled at that level.  i dont use a card reader,
	 myself  [04:08]
<nawks> mingdao: did you catch this about partprobe cmd?
<iamben> im gonna step out for a bit, good luck
<nawks> iamben: next question...  udisks is made to work with dbus.. for
	freedesktop.  it doesn't have an init.d script.  if you want
	polling/automounting in cli environment, what is proper way/tools to do
	that?  [04:10]
<marcus> do u know any not oudated guide to compiling kernel ?
<nawks> marcus: it hasn't changed in years
<iamben> there are several CLI-based udisks frontends, im having trouble
	 remembering names  [04:11]
<mingdao> nawks: no ... what about it?
<nForce> when I was emerging gcc it got stuck on "* Scanning libtool files for
	 hardcoded gcc library paths..."
<nForce> does anyone know why this might be?
<marcus> nawks:  yes but there are diferent modules and i cannot find what they
	 doing cuz help in menuconfig is rly small
<iamben> nawks: ah sys-apps/uam is one
<mingdao> nawks: "partprobe /dev/sde" where sde is the device it was before
	  unplugging?  [04:12]
<nawks> mingdao: sde is the device it is before inserting sd card which should
	become /dev/sde1 (on my system)  [04:13]
<nawks> mingdao: do you run a DE on that machine?
<mingdao> nawks: negatory
<mingdao> just Mr. Flux
<mingdao> nawks: I don't rightly remember what it was before ... leave me grep
	  some history.
<pgentoo> anyone know who the mono ebuild maintainer is?
<mingdao>  mount /dev/sdc1 /Canon-EOS/  [04:14]
<marcus>  i jsut use genkernel and comile it from working gentoo this chroot

<mingdao> pgentoo: grep Maintainer metadata.xml
<mingdao> pgentoo: Don't see it in /usr/portage/dev-lang/mono/metadata.xml ...

<pgentoo> yeah, appararently there is none
<undrwater> mingdao: i think it needed the experimental firmware loading...
<mingdao> !herd dotnet
<willikins> mingdao: (dotnet) angelos, pacho, ssuominen
<mingdao> pgentoo: Try the herd.  [04:16]
<khedrub> Anyone an idea if gentoo on the Raspberry Pi would be a decent idea?
<pgentoo> so what needs to be done to add some mono ebuilds that pull from git
	  master instead of from some tar.gz package somewhere?
<mingdao> khedrub: #rpi-gentoo or #raspberrypi might know more
<pgentoo> what is hte herd?
*** s0ra_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as sora_h
<mingdao> pgentoo: bug report
<mingdao> herd is the group all the cattle run in ... sort of  [04:17]
<khedrub> mingdao, oh, thank you. Didn't occure to me that those might exist :-)
<undrwater> khedrub: also #gentoo-embedded
<nawks> mingdao: so do 'ls /dev/sdc*' , plug in card, 'ls /dev/sdc*' ,
	'partprobe /dev/sdc' , 'ls /dev/sdc*'

<mingdao> Already done did it.
<nawks> xD
<mingdao> nawks: So, are you going to turn this into a bug in the rug, or what?
* mingdao throws nawks some good stuffs
<nawks> i'm thinking it's a misunderstanding, not a bug
<mingdao> nawks: Linux? Misunderstanding? Neavuh!!!
<mingdao> nawks: Big question ... suppose there's another card here, and it's
	  never been plugged into this Rosewell beauty. What node should it get?
									  [04:19]
<knapper_tech> gnu linux is for terrorists
<knapper_tech> and hippies
<knapper_tech> real developers use bada for everything  [04:20]
<tester> ok i hope i got all 8 cores this time
<nawks> mingdao: i don't think udev gets a msg about the card insertion.  i
	think the reader (drive) has to be polled to see the new partition when
	card is inserted
<nawks> mingdao: the cards usually come partitioned.  if it had no partition
	then it should get... NOTHING  :)  [04:21]
<nawks> mingdao: you want to install this sys-apps/uam and check it out?  [04:23]
<mingdao> nawks: So what you're saying can be ... if I partition it with
	  parted/fdisk/cfdisk in my shiny Gentoo system, then use it in my Canon
	  camera, that it Might Just Work?
<mingdao> nawks: installed ... now what?  [04:24]
<tdr> mingdao, doesn't your camera have an option to format a new card?
<nawks> mingdao: i'm saying its already working.  you just showed that in your
	paste.  i see /dev/sdc1 there
<mingdao> mgorny app .. great
<cdsboy> Hey guys I cannot for the life of me figure out this network briding
	 problem. My /etc/conf.d/net is http://pastebin.com/0n2EAVVp and I'm
	 getting "Error: an inet prefix is expected rather than
	 "142.4.2.212.155/24"." which doesn't really make sense. Any
	 suggestions?
<mingdao> tdr: Yes, sir ... and since then it doesn't mount in the card reader.
<tdr> mingdao, ah, gotcha.  i didn't see the beginning of the topic
<nawks> mingdao: it doesn't AUTOmount anymore  [04:25]
<mingdao> tdr: We've been working on these sunny beaches for a few days now. ;)
<mingdao> tdr: They are Rosewell card readers, that use an USB 10-pin header and
	  a SATA power source.
<mingdao> nawks: What do I do with uam?
<nawks> mingdao: usb auto mounter  [04:26]
<tester> everything works as planed woohoo
<tdr> mingdao, sounds like they should be a normal "disk" in the end tho, as
      long as they are polled to see when they have a card :)
<mingdao> nawks: Does It Just Work? There's no man page so I was going to his
	  website and reading.
<mingdao> tdr: nawks has just found out they're not getting properly polled
<mingdao> nawks: You know, since we ditched HAL polling hasn't been the same.
<nawks> xD  [04:27]
<marcus> is there a script that detect all modules i need and tell me what i
	 need to compile in to kernel or just lspci etc?  [04:28]
<tdr> mingdao  the website for that uam shows that
      /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs  is for setting polling
      of all ejectable media
<tdr> marcus, there is not script no.  but lspci -k  can show you the ones that
      your system is using for pci devices  [04:29]

<mingdao> nawks: https://paste.lugons.org/show/xfbzrs9DCANrEBdjmMkx/  [04:30]
<mingdao> tdr: Weird, stuff happening without my kernel knowing ... nor
	  messages.  [04:31]
<tdr> mingdao, i would be watching dmesg not messages.
<nawks> dmesgs should be in log  [04:32]
<tdr> not always  [04:33]
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<mingdao> nawks: So how do we explain this? You see nothing in dmesg
<tdr> i'd set a polling interval then try plugging it in
<nawks> mingdao: what is this?  [04:34]
<nawks> Aug 24 15:27:37 workstation kernel: [55368.232603]  sdc: sdc1
<nawks> Aug 24 15:27:37 workstation uam-mount.sh[/dev/sdc1]: mounted due to
	fstab
<tdr> my system has a default 2 second poll without even being set
<mingdao> tdr: It's just nothing in dmesg new ... here's after plugging in and
	  out twice more: https://paste.lugons.org/show/EpnstgD1yE7fTfDacHkp/
<tdr> line 38, capacity changes to zero, it *does* do something  [04:35]
<nawks> mingdao: there are 2 separate things that happen:  1)  /dev/sdc is
	polled.  card/partition is seen.  /dev/sdc1 is created.   2)  /dev/sdc1
	gets mounted
<mingdao> nawks: That's strange, too. I pulled it out with it mounted (without
	  realizing it was still mounted). Then stuck it back in and tried to
	  mount it.
<mingdao> nawks: And how come it escapes the kernel?  [04:36]
<mingdao> nawks: Where is this happening?
<tdr> mingdao, do you have fstab entries for it?
<mingdao> tdr: yes

	  noauto,users,rw,gid=1000,dmask=0002,fmask=0113,shortname=lower  0 0
<nawks> mingdao: some people might not want automounting, they just want the
	polling and device creation
<mingdao> tdr: I'm on Fluxbox and nothing automounts.
<mingdao> nawks: I'm Some People.
<tdr> mingdao, how are you saying dmesg says nothing.  lines 37, 45, 50 show
      your kernels sees it upon insertion  [04:37]

									  [04:51]
<nawks> mingdao: then insert card and do blkid
<mingdao> nawks: You typed correctly? Or cp/paste?
<iamben> SigHunter: it's likely that something related to pam/shadow is broken
<nawks> mingdao: i copied from my terminal
<SigHunter> do you think chrooting from livecd and "passwd" could fix it?
<iamben> SigHunter: try this:  "emerge -1 --noconfmem pambase pam shadow &&
	 dispatch-conf"
<iamben> you will probably need to chroot to do these things ^  [04:52]

<marcus> is eneable loadable module suprot nessesary ? i want make non modular
	 kernel but i ant to use ati fglrx later
<marcus> and i dotn rly understood this

<mingdao> nawks: How did you come across this?
<nawks> it was in that readme
<LokiChaos> hrm, ok... so I am booting now with grub2 + genkernel (will later
	    work on making a tweaked kernel).  however, nothing displays in the
	    tty (no kernel output, no boot messages, no getty, or shell)
									  [04:56]
<mingdao> nawks: How did you come across uam at all?
<LokiChaos> I KNOW it's booting, as i can blindly login & issues commands (eg:
	    shutdown) and it acts accordingly
<mingdao> LokiChaos: cat /proc/fb  [04:57]
<nawks> mingdao: iamben knew of it
<nawks> i was asking him questions
<mingdao> LokiChaos: Or do you still have nothing? If so, can you ssh into it?
<LokiChaos> mingdao: let me set up networking and then I'll ssh in
<LokiChaos> I suspsect there is an issue with UEFI & framebuffer
<mingdao> The powers of grep: 15:11 <+iamben> nawks: ah sys-apps/uam is one
									  [04:58]
<khayyam> marcus: unless this is a server you are setting up, with a very
	  specifc (and limited) config, the modular is really a better approach,
	  eg: how often will you use a filesystem like vfat, having it modular
	  will mean its not using resouces when not being used, similarly with
	  NFS, netfilter, etc, etc
<mingdao> nawks: Thanks. Which kernel are you running atm?
<nawks> iamben: /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs sets polling
	for removable block devices
<nawks> mingdao: 3.5.2
<nawks> and it actually meands UDev Auto Mounter, not USB Auto Mounter  [04:59]
<marcus> im always using ntfs cuz i got ntfs partition for   files  cuz need it
	 also under windows xd  so its always mounted all dwonloads going there
	 etc
<marcus> but i see yoru point
<mingdao> nawks: Same here ... 3.3.8-gentoo-cardread is going rm System.map.old
	  config.old vmlinuz.old
<tdr> khayyam, it doesn't use resources to have a driver loaded and not in use
      anyway.   code used for devices not present simply isn't touched until
      they are there.
<khayyam> marcus: NFS, vfat, were examples ...
<nawks> mingdao: when is the last time that card reader worked like you
	expected?  when you had HAL?  [05:01]
<mingdao> nawks: Never had HAL on this machine.  [05:02]
<khayyam> tdr: this isn't true for netfilter, but I mean to use the term
	  'resources' in a more general sense
<mingdao> nawks: When we moved back to America from China we only brought one
	  laptop, and some hard drives out of a server.
<tdr> khayyam, just saying wasting resources isn't a valid arguement for using
      modules vs monolithic kernels  [05:03]
<mingdao> nawks: So everything here is custom built since Feb 2011.
<mingdao> nawks: This machine has had some mobo swaps, but the same basic WD
	  VelociRaptors in RAID0 since it's inception.
*** Kripton (kripton-fr@staff.kripserver.net) is now known as kripton  [05:04]

	  Canon EOS.
<mingdao> nawks: So, it's only had Gentoo and no HAL.
<mingdao> nawks: My comment about HAL was concerning I've not known any polling
	  at intervals on my LAN since using Slackware (which still uses HAL).
									  [05:05]
<khayyam> tdr: well, there is also the question of flexability .. for instance,
	  I can have issues with ath5k that can be solved by unloading the
	  modules
<mingdao> nawks: So, tbh, I can't say when the card reader last worked.  [05:06]
<tdr> khayyam, specific devices, sure.  mostly tho, i use zero modules unless i
      absolutely need to and i'm not taking performance or stability hits
<mingdao> nawks: Thanks for fixing this issue with/for me. Now I'm going to
	  build a doghouse with my daughter for her new puppy. ;)
<nawks> mingdao: hehe, don't forget the autofeeder.  have fun o/  [05:07]
<frax_> can anyone explain and maybe help me fix why my custom startup script
	won't show in rc.log, plz.
<mingdao> nawks: HALP!
<mingdao> nawks: It's even autmounting devices on my Fluxbox system: /dev/sdf1

<mingdao> nawks: Just for giggles I plugged the SATA drive in, to see if it
	  still works.
<nawks> swweet!  that could be the uam scripts i guess
<nawks> you might have to remove that if u don't want automount  [05:09]
<mingdao> nawks: As Gomer would say, "Shazaam!"
	  https://paste.lugons.org/show/oUv3jSAX6BJcUIBdXIjC/
<khayyam> tdr: except for servers, I generally compile as modular as possible
	  for laptops/netbooks it means that with sleep/hibernate I can work
	  arround issues
<tdr> khayyam, my laptops sleep/hibernate fine without modules, and using normal
      vanilla-sources or gentoo-sources and no special tools.  [05:10]
<mingdao> nawks: I don't mind, so long as I understand what it's doing. I'll put
	  a mount point in fstab so I'll know where it gets mounted; cause
	  /media/ST98823AS_5PK2SV3M-1 doesn't mean much to me. ;)
<nawks> mingdao: my problem is i broke something simple with kernel upgrade.
	then i prob fixed it quickly, but i was doing all my testing from cli,
	without udiskd running
<mingdao> nawks: No udisks on this comp.
<nawks> mingdao: or you can make a udev rule for it.  i can send a link to a

	  rarely  [05:14]
<tdr> Khas, by default i dont think it's put in /etc or anything. locate only
      shows it as /usr/share/doc/rtorrent-0.9.2/rtorrent.rc.bz2 for me
<msichal> hm, or maybe it just isn't set anywhere
<Khas> tdr: yeah, everything says it's ~/.rtorrent.rc, which makes sense as

<trumee> is it possible to use an old alsa with a newer kernel?
<trumee> There is no alsa-driver package in portage now?  [05:23]
<khayyam> trumee: because its not needed ... alsa is in kernel
<Frigolit> trumee: using in-kernel alsa is recommended, also it's has a "Support
	   old ALSA API" option
<Frigolit> it has*  [05:24]
<trumee> Frigolit: i want to use alsa 1.24.2 rather than present version in the
	 kernel
<Frigolit> trumee: any specific reason?
<trumee> Frigolit: my device is broken in the new version
<Frigolit> ah
<trumee> Frigolit: it works fine on openwrt with alsa 1.24.2 and kernel 3.3.8,
	 but is broken in gentoo 'alsa 1.25.0 and kernel 3.3.8'  [05:25]
<trumee> seems openwrt were smart in not upgrading to the new alsa
<Frigolit> you could skip upgrading the kernel and wait a couple of versions and
	   try a new kernel then  [05:26]
<khayyam> trumee: are you sure its actualy broken?
<trumee> khayyam: yes, the sliders are not incremental, they go from 0 to 1 in
	 one step
<trumee> khayyam: for the 'capture' mic and line-in
<Frigolit> sounds like something that should get resolved pretty fast  [05:27]
<khayyam> what about 1-9 keys?
<khayyam> trumee: it sounds like more an issue with alsa-utils than the drivers
	  though  [05:30]
<trumee> khayyam: 1-9 keys dont work as expected  [05:31]
<khayyam> trumee: hmmmm .. so they all behave as mute  [05:32]

<khayyam> Doomhammer: or rather you would think there would be, but there isn't
	  :)  [07:25]
<LokiChaos> Doomhammer: take it up with Poettering :(
<Doomhammer> i mean not allowing separate /usr is whatever
<hasues> Is mdev going to be the new device manager?
<Doomhammer> but having it start AFTER localmount also makes it so i cannot have
	     persistent net rules if i have network filesystems in /etc/fstab,
	     which is just retarded
<iamben> hasues: no, it's a minimal rescue dev manager
<iamben> it's a replacement like bb is a replacement for bash  [07:26]

		a smaller software dep tree
<Doomhammer> iamben: i need persistent net naming, however localmount mounts my
	     nfs shares BEFORE udev starts, so when udev starts it cannot rename
	     the interfaces as they've already been started
<Doomhammer> or, rather, attempts to mount my nfs shares and fails because the
	     interfaces it's using are wrong  [07:31]
<hasues> Doomhammer, perhaos use autofs vs localmount
<solidus-river> or emerge with binary packages?  [07:32]
<khayyam> solidus-river: gentoo-prefix
<bloody> Doomhammer: similar here, annoyed by this because im trying to build a
	 livecd...
<hasues> Solidus: gentoo prefixing?  And profile selecting
<Doomhammer> can we just fork udev :P
<iamben> Doomhammer: interesting problem.  could probably be solved in initramfs
	 if you're into that kind of thing  [07:33]
<bloody> Doomhammer: and let the fork write runtime stuff in /var not /etc?
<Doomhammer> iamben: i'm not :(
<Doomhammer> bloody: have udev reside entirely on /, rather than in /usr or /var
	     - similar to how all other boot tools are in /(s)bin instead of
	     /usr/(s)bin  [07:34]

<hasues> Gentoo prefixing only works on older versions of macos however...lion
	 and mountain lion may not work

<Doomhammer> bloody: what kernel version?
<iamben> Doomhammer: you can do this with controlling module load order, i'd
	 imagine
<bloody> the new stable amd64 gentoo-sources-3.4.9
<hasues> Doomhammer: why would it change?  Unless your macs do
<Doomhammer> hasues: without persistent net rules eth* are named based on their
	     PCI bus order - right?  [07:36]
<iamben> bloody: what gcc are you on?
<annihilator> iamben: if i was to install on a computer with a similar buildout
	      could i just transfer my .config files over to that compouter and
	      some of more generic settings such as the make settings
<Doomhammer> bloody: i just built that kernel a few moments ago on amd64 with
	     gcc-4.6.3  [07:37]
<bloody> Doomhammer: 4.5.4 pl0 the current stable
<hasues> Doomhammer: i thought the 70-net rules used the Mac to write the
	 interface names
<Doomhammer> hasues: it does, however those rules working requires that they
	     execute BEFORE the interfaces are brought up
<bloody> Doomhammer: maybe i shouldnt use genkernel all... :D
<bloody> Doomhammer: stupid stuff ala: drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_scsi.c:1900:11:
	 error: unused variable ‘rc’  [07:38]
<Doomhammer> hasues: however, localmount starts before udev, since udev requires
	     /usr, and localmount /also/ mounts nfs shares in fstab, thereby
	     starting the interfaces before udev and screwing up the rules
<hasues> Doomhammer: mine are using the mac address...so
<hasues> Dont mount nfs in fstab...use autofs
<iamben> Doomhammer: couldn't you just make netmount depend on udev?  [07:39]

	 gentoo box atm...ican't
<iamben> wait what
<iamben> how is nfs being mounted before udev starts & renames the interfaces?
<hasues> I think he has entries in fstab  [07:40]
<hasues> And claims that is when it occurs
<iamben> those should be parsed by netmount, not localmount
<hasues> agreed
<hasues> But to be sure i would use autofs anyway
<Doomhammer> iamben: what if i add "need udev" to net.lo?  [07:41]
<Doomhammer> as that's really the dependency i want
<iamben> Doomhammer: udev happens in boot runlevel, both netmount and net.eth*
	 should happen in default  [07:42]
<Doomhammer> can't dependencies force things out of the runlevel they are in?
									  [07:43]
<iamben> it can force them to start earlier, sure
<hasues> ?
<Doomhammer> changing net.lo to depend on udev seems to have fixed it v0v
									  [07:44]
<iamben> did you have net.* all in boot runlevel?
<Doomhammer> iamben: all of my interfaces are in default  [07:45]
<Doomhammer> net.lo is in boot, though  [07:46]
<Doomhammer> which makes sense actually
<iamben> what about netmount, was that in boot?
<iamben> or some other net-needing service?
<Doomhammer> netmount is in default, udev is in sysinit
<iamben> there should have been no way that net.eth* and netmount happened
	 before udev
<Doomhammer> iamben: localmount depends on modules, and my network drivers are
	     all compiled as modules - perhaps that's the issue?  [07:47]
<iamben> i wouldn't think so, unless rc hotplug saw the net modules loaded and
	 decided to instantly start the corresponding net services... im not
	 very familiar with rc plugging  [07:48]
<Doomhammer> i haven't added them to /etc/conf.d/modules to be autoloaded,
	     however, so they should be loaded as-needed (i.e., after udev)
<hasues> That shouldnt matter  [07:49]
<iamben> if they're all modules, just control their load order and forget about
	 udev's persistent naming  [07:50]
<Doomhammer> iamben: how does one accomplish that?
<Doomhammer> iamben: also, two of my nics use e1000e - how would that be
	     accounted for?
<iamben> the order you list them in conf.d/modules corresponds with the load
	 order, it may be reversed though, i can't remember  [07:52]
<Doomhammer> anyway i thought that these rules files were the only benefit of
	     udev over a static /dev?

<iamben> well, and all the integration with modern DE's & stuff
<Doomhammer> that's true actually
<GentooLiveSpiffy> Hey, after updating to a new kernel+udev, barely anything
		 starts on boot anymore, because udev-mount would not start
<GentooLiveSpiffy> Udev swears up and down that I don't have a flag in my kernel
		 config enabled, when I do  [07:54]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> I made sure that it was the kernel being compiled against
<Doomhammer> GentooLiveSpiffy: as in, you can verify you have the flag with zcat
	     /proc/config.gz | grep "CONFIG_foo" ?
<Doomhammer> GentooLiveSpiffy: when you build udev it's looking at
	     /usr/src/linux/.config to check for certain flags
<GentooLiveSpiffy> yes, I grepped there for it, and it was there  [07:55]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> CONFIG_DEVTMPFS and CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT
<GentooLiveSpiffy> this is someone with a problem like mine:
		 http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-917162-highlight-.html
									  [07:56]
<bloody> btw., does anyone know if its safe to build udev with no kernel
	 source/config present? (in an attempt to save disk space)
<hasues> I dont think i ever do  [07:57]
<iamben> bloody: afaik you just need linux-headers, the config check in udev is
	 non-fatal
<bloody> iamben: that would be nice, otherwise i'd have to unpack the kernel
	 sources with each emerge upgrade.. thx :)  [07:58]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> also, when I ran etc-update, I threw out the update to the
		 rc.conf...do you think that has something to do with it?
									  [07:59]
<Doomhammer> GentooLiveSpiffy: depends on how big of a version number jump the
	     upgrade was
<Doomhammer> although fwiw /etc/rc.conf comes from openrc, not udev, i believe
									  [08:00]
<bloody> Doomhammer: now the kernel built fine. had to remove one scsi
	 driver... maybe i should file a bug?
<Doomhammer> bloody: sounds like it
<GentooLiveSpiffy> last time I did an emerge --sync/ update world was last month
*** pilojo (pilojo@unaffiliated/pilojo66) is now known as pilojo|away
<Doomhammer> GentooLiveSpiffy: it's almost certainly fine, then
<bloody> boy i hate filing bugs, its usually my fault and no bug anywhere :O
<Doomhammer> bloody: worst that'll happen is they close it and explain why,
	     otherwise you've helped out :)  [08:01]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> the last version of OpenRC I had was 9.8.4, updated to 10.5
<GentooLiveSpiffy> revdep-rebuild finds a problem with lvm2, but can't re-emerge
		 it, I'll pastebin the log  [08:03]
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: I had the same issue (lvm2)
<bloody> bye all & thx  [08:04]
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: bascially, updating udev is bad idea as there are
	  too many additonal packages that also need keyworded, and in my
	  experience break
<adrakoa> hi  [08:05]
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: I did this when trying out mkinitcpio ... and soon
	  backtracked
<khayyam> adrakoa: hey
<GentooLiveSpiffy> I was having difficulty earlier with some old apps with the
		 udisks flag needing an old version, but I changed my
		 package.use and they compiled fine
<GentooLiveSpiffy> do you think I should install an older version of udev?
									  [08:06]
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: as I said, > 171 will require many other additonal
	  dependencies keyworded  [08:07]
<Doomhammer> GentooLiveSpiffy: i had a similar issue and i ended up just using
	     ~amd64 udev -- although you can apparently, via useflags, convince
	     everythign to build with older udev
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: the final of which was lvm2 which I wasn't able to
	  resolve at that point in time
<Doomhammer> GentooLiveSpiffy: i'm using udev-188, udev-init-scripts-16,
	     lvm2-2.02.95-r3
<GentooLiveSpiffy> when I enter "emerge -C udev -p" it says something about it
		 being part of my system profile, should I go ahead, then
		 install the older version?  [08:09]
<iamben> GentooLiveSpiffy: why would you need to unmerge the current version to
	 get an older one?
<GentooLiveSpiffy> ooh, o
<GentooLiveSpiffy> k
<Doomhammer> GentooLiveSpiffy: basically, just DO NOT REBOOT until you have a
	     working udev installed - and what iamben says is correct, you can
	     downgrade in one go rather than manually removing  [08:10]
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: just, un-keyword and emerge, it'll install the
	  relevant package
<GentooLiveSpiffy> should I just mask the newer udev?
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: it depends on what you have as ACCEPT_KEYWORDS, 171
	  is currently 'stable'  [08:11]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> here's what happens when I pretend to install 171:
		 http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=RWF0tqAg
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: unmerge udev-init-scripts  [08:12]
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: 171 doesn't need or have that package
<GentooLiveSpiffy> ok, now I'm getting another error  [08:13]
<nawks> Doomhammer: what if you brought up interfaces in default runlevel
	instead of boot?
<nawks> i never tried it but it might work
<GentooLiveSpiffy> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=RWF0tqAg
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: unmerge udev-init-scripts  [08:14]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> I did
<Doomhammer> nawks: they are in default; some dependency was forcing them to
	     start in boot, however making them depend on udev fixed it
<nawks> cool  [08:15]
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: no, "sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-16::gentoo, installed"

<GentooLiveSpiffy> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=LKqLrzJV  [08:20]
<nawks> what is udev-init-scripts for and what requires it?  [08:24]
<nawks> i've never had gnome or kde bring it in  [08:25]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> it came with the newest udev
<nawks> ah
<Doomhammer> the problem is that portage isn't computing dependencies very
	     intelligently for xfce
<nawks> well xfce uses some gnome stuff  [08:26]
<nawks> i'm not surprised gvfs wants udisks
<Doomhammer> nawks: which is fine, but it's telling everyone they need ~arch
	     udev, when really if you tweak use flags in some nonsensical manner
	     you can use stable udev
<Phr33d0m> then make a forum post or something to let people know about it
									  [08:28]
<Doomhammer> tbh i'm not even sure precisely what use flags are needed, i gave
	     up and installed udev-188  [08:29]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> how did you get everything working, Doomhammer?  [08:30]
<Doomhammer> GentooLiveSpiffy: http://pastebin.com/agrEXFSm more or less  [08:34]
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: what is your ACCEPT_KEYWORDS set to?
<GentooLiveSpiffy> ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="amd64"
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: so sys-fs/udev-186 must be the amd64 keyworded
	  package  [08:35]
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: so, to downgrade to 171-6 you need to mask packages
	  above this  [08:36]
<nawks> GentooLiveSpiffy: do you have gimp installed?  that's the only pkg i
	have demanding gvfs  [08:37]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> nawks, yes
<khayyam> GentooLiveSpiffy: thats why I said above 171 doesn't need
	  udev-init-scripts
<nawks> GentooLiveSpiffy: qdepends -qQ gvfs
<GentooLiveSpiffy> nawks, no output  [08:38]
<nawks> weird.  do you have gnome flag set?
<GentooLiveSpiffy> nawks, nope, it's -gnome

	intelligently"  [08:39]

<NoirSoldats> I updated grub 0.97 and, as usual, went to grub --no-floppy it and

<NoirSoldats> problems*
<StrayLite> I have a weird problem I tinhk is related to pulseaudio settings but
	    cannot figure out how to fix it. If I am on a Skype call and p try
	    to wathc a youtube video then the video has no sound... same with
	    trying to play music. If I am playing music or watching a video and
	    start a Skype call then sound does not work for Skype.

	    hardware
<StrayLite> Also, the volume contorl has no affect.  [10:21]

	      have worked fine?
<mingdao> StrayLite: Just play old ALSA gives me more sounds than I want.
<mingdao> NoirSoldats: Not enough info, really.  [10:22]
<StrayLite> mingdao: Can I do that with gnome3? It configured itself with
	    pulseaudio
<mingdao> StrayLite: Never used Gnome*

<GentooLiveSpiffy> *an Intel
<mingdao> I've heard of those.
<naucs> StrayLite: you ran mint on this same machine and it worked?
<GentooLiveSpiffy> if you need more specs, it's a Toshiba Qosmio X775-Q7170
									  [10:24]
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: Sporting a measleyi5-2520M
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: Let's use some more sane flags, eh?
<StrayLite> naucs: Yes
<StrayLite> Mint MATE
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: In /etc/make.conf you presently have: CFLAGS="-Os
	  -pipe -march=native -fomit-frame-pointer"  [10:25]
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: Please try: CFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe"
<naucs> StrayLite:  at least one app is not aware of pulse and is grabbing alsa
	directly
<StrayLite> hmm
<naucs> if it worked on mint maybe alsa dmix was working which lets more than
	one app grab alsa
<GentooLiveSpiffy> mingdao, done
<naucs> so maybe getting dmix working is a fix
<NoirSoldats> GentooLiveSpiffy: mingdao: Turn off sandbox then turn it back on
	      once VLC compiles..?  [10:26]
<naucs> i have to work on dmix myself.  but not tonight _._
<StrayLite> It happens with mpd, totem movie player, skype and the flash plugin
	    for firefox
<StrayLite> All of them are not playing well together  [10:27]
<StrayLite> It seems everything wants exclusive use of the hardware
<naucs> totem uses gstreamer iirc  [10:28]
<naucs> install gst-plugins-pulse
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: I have this on my i5: media-video/vlc-2.0.3  USE="X
	  a52 aac alsa avcodec avformat cdda dbus dts dvbpsi dvd encode ffmpeg
	  flac gcrypt gnutls libnotify mmx mp3 mpeg ncurses ogg opengl png
	  postproc qt4 sdl sse svg swscale theora truetype udev vaapi vorbis
	  x264 xcb xml xv"
<naucs> sandbox violation is from when the build stupidly tries to install
	things directly into the system
<naucs> probably requires a bug report to fix  [10:29]
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: What is your system doing atm?
<annihilator> i wisht this grub install would install
<naucs> people who are willing to risk it writing into their system and possibly
	doing nasty things can disable the sandbox restrictions
<GentooLiveSpiffy> mingdao, compiling Chromium
* mingdao has 1 wire, 1 daughter, 2 dogs waiting to watch a movie  [10:30]
<NoirSoldats> annihilator: what's it doing?
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: There are others here who can help you.
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: Is this a fresh install? Or, how old system?
<GentooLiveSpiffy> mingdao, ok, enjoy your movie
<NoirSoldats> mingdao: A wire?
<NoirSoldats> :P
<naucs> she's thing
<GentooLiveSpiffy> I installed Gentoo at the end of May
<naucs> she's thin*
<mingdao> s/wire/wife
<NoirSoldats> LOL
<GentooLiveSpiffy> haha
<mingdao> hope she didn't see that
<annihilator> compiling and installing
<mingdao> <:-)}
<NoirSoldats> mingdao: be safe.
<mingdao> really
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: You had this running long? This Gentoo install?
									  [10:31]
<annihilator> i did emerge grub and its taken over an hr so far
<GentooLiveSpiffy> yes
<GentooLiveSpiffy> I'm a newbie, but I get by with a lot of help from my friend
		 BitWraith
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: After chromium finished did you have another
	  command?
<GentooLiveSpiffy> no, nothing after that  [10:32]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> I've been using Linux since 2004
<naucs> annihilator: that's crazy
<naucs> sudo su
<annihilator> its on 41 out of 30
<mingdao> !seen BitWraith
<willikins> mingdao: BitWraith was last seen 40 minutes and 58 seconds ago,
	    saying "her /etc/resolv.conf was old" in #gentoo
<annihilator> 47*
<annihilator> wt crap
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: when that finishes maybe "emerge -a --depclean &&
	  revdep-rebuild -i"  [10:33]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> ok  [10:34]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> thank you very much for your help
<annihilator> 47 prgrams for grub?
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: But then, just to 'spiff' up your system, with those
	  'bit more sane' CFLAGS, how about a "eix-sync && emerge -aDjNuv
	  --with-bdeps=y @world && dispatch-conf && emerge -a --depclean &&
	  revdep-rebuild -i" ?
<naucs> 47 out of 30?  it's rly going to town xD  [10:35]
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: That's rather like cleaning out your chitlin', but
	  will make some nice cleanups.
<GentooLiveSpiffy> maybe, I've been updating since this morning (I'm in the US),
		 I'm eager to do things that use the processor that aren't
		 updating :)
<Garibaldi> GentooLiveSpiffy: sounds like you need to amortize your update costs
	    over a larger amount of time  [10:36]
<StrayLite> naucs: Should I have had pulseaudio in my USE variable for the
	    installation of all the apps that use sound?
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: And the suggestion to consider my VLC flags? And it
	  your system is mixed or ~amd64, try 2.0.3 ... nice release.
<GentooLiveSpiffy> mingdao, I'll use your VLC flags  [10:37]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> Garibaldi, I like to update once a month, to quote Calvin
		 from Calvin and Hobbes, that means the work is more stressful,
		 but there's less of it. :)
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: j with emerge will speed up some
<naucs> StrayLite: yes you should, so they can be pulse aware, the ones that are
	able  [10:38]
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: My mornings start with 8 Gentoo systems start with a
	  /root/.bashrc alias ud='eix-sync && emerge -aDjNuv @world &&
	  dispatch-conf && emerge -a --depclean && revdep-rebuild -i && clear &&
	  exit'  [10:39]
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: coffee and ud keep my system and my Gentoo boxen
	  cleaned out <:-)}
<GentooLiveSpiffy> oh wow XD
<mingdao> GentooLiveSpiffy: Best wishes getting your shiny Gentoo system back on
	  track!
<Garibaldi> mingdao: yeah, that's the way to go
<mingdao> Garibaldi: I'm too lazy to work too many bugs at once. :p  [10:40]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> thank you!
<Garibaldi> mingdao: indeed
<mingdao> moff
<dlan> mingdao: and keep your cpu hot too ~  [10:42]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> Q: What do you call an overheating Macbook?
<GentooLiveSpiffy> Q: A baked Apple.
<naucs> mingdao:  how does it feel to break eight machines at once?  [10:43]
<dol-sen> D-Chymera1: maybe try rebuilding glib anyway  [10:46]
<K0HAX> I'm going to emerge gnome on my raspberry pi. :D  [10:49]
<naucs> insanity can be beautiful  [10:50]
<sczi> tell us how it goes once you've finished in a week or two  [10:53]
<applejack> anyone able to give me a clue as to what is needed to be able to use
	    the gnome desktops (Places|Network) to browse my local windows
	    network? I have samba configured and joined to the domain, and I can
	    browse this computer from a windows machine, so what am I missing?
									  [11:06]
<dmp450> how do I mount an external USB HDD through the terminal? I have a mount
	 point, but it asks me to specify a file system and I don't know how to
	 see which filesystem I have  [11:07]
<qpdb> applejack: maybe samba useflag for gnome-base/gvfs?
<applejack> I have the samba use flag in make.conf  [11:08]
<naucs> dmp450: try blkid
<qpdb> got flash and gnash installed, want to use gnash in one browser(firefox,
       works), and flash in another(epiphany, also uses gnash, but want it to
       use flash), howto?  [11:09]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> qpdb, did you try disabling Flash in Firefox and Gnash in
		 Epiphany?  [11:10]
<dmp450> naucs, says sdd2 is ntfs, but when I try to mount it says it's the
	 wrong file system type
<naucs> dmp450: -t vfat
<qpdb> GentooLiveSpiffy: could not find out on how to disable plugins in
       epiphany  [11:11]
<naucs> dmp450: derp, no
<naucs> dmp450: umm...  you built ntfs support?
<dmp450> yeah, has ntfs support
<naucs> fuse and ntfs3g?
<dmp450> naucs, yup
<applejack> qpdb: thanks, samba was not enabled when gvfs was installed - lol
<hypnocat> how can i make sure that a symbolic link from /dev/dvd and /dev/cdrom
	   is made to /dev/sr0 on boot?  [11:13]
<naucs> dmp450: tried -t ntfs-3g ?  [11:15]
<dmp450> naucs, what is that?  [11:16]
<dmp450> says it's unknown
<dmp450> I misread your last question about the 3g, just thought you meant ntfs
	 :P
<naucs> dmp450: and u tried -t ntfs i guess  [11:18]
<dmp450> yeah :(
<annihilator> i got a problem  [11:21]
<annihilator> grub cannot detect my boot file
<annihilator> its grub 2
<annihilator> should i rename the bzImage to like kernel-3.5.2-gentoo ?  [11:22]
<naucs> dmp450: can you find errors in messages/dmesg?
<dmp450> naucs, http://pastebin.com/3q0rPBME  [11:23]
<annihilator> anyone?  [11:24]
<tenX> annihilator: i'd rename it to clearify  [11:25]
*** HououinKyouma (Kyouma@bzq-79-181-229-185.red.bezeqint.net) is now known as
    Guest56796  [11:26]
<annihilator> ok
<naucs> dmp450: is it actually bigger than 2TB?
<dmp450> naucs, yes...  [11:27]
<annihilator> and one other question what is the terminal command to rename?
<annihilator> rn?
<dmp450> is that bad?
<naucs> that's what it says :P
<dmp450> Can I do anything then?
<naucs> NTFS-fs error (device sdd2): parse_ntfs_boot_sector(): Volume size
	(2TiB) is too large for this architecture.  Maximum supported is 2TiB.
	Sorry.   SORRY
<naucs> you could try fuse and ntfs-3g
<dmp450> naucs, okay, thanks :)  [11:28]
<naucs> you know fuse?  kernel fs option
<dmp450> yeah, I know fuse  [11:29]
<naucs> then install ntfs-3g pkg
<dmp450> okay
<naucs> i have no idea if it handles larger volumes
<dmp450> ugh  [11:30]
<dmp450> i might try to find a different work around :P
<yi_> hi guys.. I have a laptop connected to a monitor through VGA.. everything
      works as it should but whenever I maximize something on one monitor, it
      winds up spanning both monitors. Is there anyway to only have it maximize
      on one monitor?  [11:33]
<ss23> Install Windows
<ss23> :)
<yi_> lol.. yeah I think it does work on windows  [11:34]
<naucs> dmp450: Because partition tables on master boot record (MBR) disks only
	support partition sizes up to 2 TB, dynamic or GPT volumes must be used
	to create NTFS volumes over 2 TB.  [11:38]
<naucs> you using gpt?
<dmp450> naucs, I am using gpt  [11:39]
<annihilator> night all
<naucs> dmp450: well you should try ntfs-3g and see what it does  [11:42]
<dmp450> okay, i'll give that a shot  [11:43]
<dmp450> what I'm thinking of doing now is mounting the drive on a computer I
	 know works
<dmp450> then mount my other one through sshfs and copy my files from my
	 external HDD over ssh. will be slow, but should work  [11:44]
<q0_0p> so what is this talk about gpt
<q0_0p> something about hdd's being over 2TB being a problem?
<dmp450> q0_0p, i can't mount my external usb drive  [11:45]
<q0_0p> dmp450, what is it formatted in?
<dmp450> ntfs  [11:46]
<q0_0p> dmp450, sudo mount -t auto ntfs-3g /your_partition /your_mount_point
<q0_0p> woops  [11:47]
<q0_0p> sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /your_partition /your_mount_point
<dmp450> q0_0p, it doesn't like me trying to do ntfs-3g  [11:49]
<dmp450> I think it doesn't support it. have to add it in :(
<dmp450> just copying over ssh now :P
<q0_0p> :)  [11:50]
<naucs> yi_: you using xinerama?
<naucs> yi_: http://x.debian.net/howto/use-xrandr.html  [11:51]
<yi_> naucs: no
<yi_> naucs: reading about xrandr now  [11:52]
<q0_0p> so is gpt the future?  [11:59]
<brian|lfs> do I want low latency desktop or pre-emptive kernel to stop music
	    form skipping?  [12:35]
<Fieldy> neither of those is going to stop that issue... you have far more
	 serious issues going on  [12:37]
<Fieldy> brian|lfs: are you using gentoo?
<brian|lfs> it don't skip all the time
<brian|lfs> just now and then
<brian|lfs> ya
<brian|lfs> intel i7 16gb of ram  [12:38]
<brian|lfs> my gentoo install on a 250 gb SSD
<khayyam> brian|lfs: low latency is preemption ... "Preemption Model"
<brian|lfs> that's what I thought
<khayyam> brian|lfs: but as Feildy said ... this is probably not the issue
									  [12:39]
<brian|lfs> any other kernel options I should check?
<brian|lfs> its weird it snot skipping now but it was earlier  [12:40]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: there are other factors, such as scheduler (IOSCHED), audio
	  card, concurrent processes, etc
<brian|lfs> I just compiled kernel 3.4.9
<brian|lfs> for audio I'm using a creative XFI  [12:41]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: what do you have set as Timer frequency
<brian|lfs> where is that in the kernel I'll check  [12:42]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: Processor Type and Features
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<rhorse> brian|lfs: buffer size can be expanded in mpg321, not sure about other
	 apps
<brian|lfs> found it I"m on 1000hz right now  [12:43]
<brian|lfs> would think that would be bad for audio
<khayyam> brian|lfs: thats generally what you would have set for a desktop
<khayyam> brian|lfs: what about I/O scheduler?  [12:44]
<brian|lfs> looking
<khayyam> brian|lfs: Enable Block Layer => I/O Scheduler
<brian|lfs> CFQ
<brian|lfs> and Deadline IO Scheduler  [12:45]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: OK ... thats good (though you might get better scheduling
	  with BFQ, but thats a patch)
<khayyam> brian|lfs: but default is CFQ?
<brian|lfs> thats what I thought I'm default
<brian|lfs> I don't change to much stuff unless I know what I"m changing lol
									  [12:46]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: and HIGH_RES_TIMERS is =y?
<brian|lfs> checking
<brian|lfs> any idea where that is located  [12:48]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: Processor Type and Features
<khayyam> brian|lfs: also look and check that SMP is =y  [12:49]
<brian|lfs> ah right in front of me its on
<brian|lfs> maybe pulseaudio is just the lag
<khayyam> brian|lfs: ahhh .. you didn't mention that .. could be
<brian|lfs> I'm just thinking  [12:50]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: but anyhow, Processor family 'Core 2'?
<brian|lfs> with out pulse apps can't play audio at the same time that good
<brian|lfs> I have an I7
<brian|lfs> just have it set for x86_64
<brian|lfs> I could do core 2 if you think that's a better choice  [12:51]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: you have an i7 option?
<brian|lfs> no option for an I7
<brian|lfs> got intel atom core 2 zeon or P4  [12:52]
<brian|lfs> Opteron Athlon for AMD
<khayyam> brian|lfs: right and core2 is "Intel Core 2 and newer Core 2 Xeons
	  (Xeon 51xx and 53xx) CPU"
*** s0ra_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as sora_h
<brian|lfs> good point  [12:53]
<brian|lfs> every bit helps
<khayyam> brian|lfs: ok, so core2
<brian|lfs> yup picked now
<khayyam> brian|lfs: "maximum number of CPU's" is set to what?  [12:54]
*** pilojo (pilojo@unaffiliated/pilojo66) is now known as pilojo|away
<brian|lfs> 8
<khayyam> brian|lfs: and Muticore sched is enabled?
<brian|lfs> yup on
<GentooLiveSpiffy> all right, my system is nearly completely salvaged
<brian|lfs> what happened to your system GentooLiveSpiffy  [12:55]
<GentooLiveSpiffy> a udev upgrade messed it up a lot
<khayyam> brian|lfs: ok, high mem support enabled?
<brian|lfs> SMT Hyperthreading is on
<brian|lfs> yup
<brian|lfs> wow
<GentooLiveSpiffy> however, when I try to connect to my network with Wicd, the
		 progress bar moves and it goes through (I think) all the steps,
		 but it ends with "Not connected"
<khayyam> brian|lfs: Tickless system?  [12:56]
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h  [12:57]
<brian|lfs> whats tickless under
<khayyam> brian|lfs: Processor Type and Features  [12:58]
<naucs> you are recommending tickless?
<brian|lfs> oh tickless is on
<khayyam> brian|lfs: ok ...  [12:59]
<khayyam> brian|lfs: next under Power management and ACPI options => CPUFreq
<khayyam> brian|lfs: Default CPUFreq governor?
<GentooLiveSpiffy> I type "route" in the chroot, and it tells me "INET (IPv4)
		 not configured in this system."  [13:00]
<khayyam> naucs: not necessarily, no
<brian|lfs> performance is on right now
<brian|lfs> for governor
<khayyam> brian|lfs: ok, well with all that, the only thing I might change is
	  'Tickless System'  [13:02]
<brian|lfs> to on or off
<brian|lfs> ?
<brian|lfs> Its on right now
<khayyam> brian|lfs: I have it off ... but this is recommended for the BFQ sched
<brian|lfs> I'll try mine off
<khayyam> brian|lfs: I'm not sure what the case is for CFQ ... but it generally
	  comes enabled  [13:03]
<brian|lfs> how do I patch for BFQ
<brian|lfs> I wouldn't mind trying BFQ
<khayyam> brian|lfs: its available I think with the pf-sources ... or you cand
	  d/l from ck's site  [13:04]
<brian|lfs> I'll grab pf-sources
<naucs> your computer is so fast
<brian|lfs> and just copy my config file  [13:05]
<brian|lfs> and change to BFQ
<khayyam> brian|lfs: yes, its in pf-sources
<naucs> brian|lfs: you need to look at alsa buffer size
<khayyam> naucs: there is also pulseaudio in the mix  [13:06]
<LokiChaos> bah, oss overlay is broken :/
<naucs> yes, need to check that config too
<brian|lfs> anyway to get autounmask back
<brian|lfs> I don't care for the one in emerge now
<brian|lfs> will do
<brian|lfs> is alsa buffer size in the kernel
<brian|lfs> '?  [13:07]
<naucs> yes, might depend on what driver you using
<naucs> i don't think it applies to usb audio
<brian|lfs> I"m using a xfi card
<khayyam> brian|lfs: something else that might have some baring here is if you
	  disk is encrypted (LUKS) and/or filesystem used  [13:08]
<naucs> brian|lfs: ok, alsa...  hr-timer backend enabled  [13:10]
<brian|lfs> HR TIMER IS ENABLED  [13:11]
<brian|lfs> woops
<naucs> creative xfi... don't see any config options for it  [13:12]
<brian|lfs> I don't either
<naucs> well that's that :)
<brian|lfs> going to compile this kernel
<naucs> brian|lfs: did you check pci options?  [13:13]
<brian|lfs> I'll check in a sec little late already compiling  [13:14]
<naucs> ok, well if its not crashing you prob dont have any major issues there
<brian|lfs> nah no crashes  [13:15]
<naucs> you can do lspci -vv and look at your creative card and check that

<brian|lfs> sorry about that

<oohy9n> what is the best tutorial to install a mail server on a gentoo server?
<oohy9n> is this alright
	 http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server
<khayyam> oohy9n: I've not used that tutorial, but I use postfix, and can
	  recommend  [13:21]
<oohy9n> khayyam what tutorial have you used
<oohy9n> this is my first time setting something like this up tbh
<khayyam> oohy9n: I didn't I read the documentation :)
<oohy9n> best tutorial :)  [13:22]
<naucs> oohy9n: you need a heavy duty server?
<oohy9n> no
<oohy9n> something personal, small
<naucs> thats overkill then
<oohy9n> 1-2 domains, couple dozens user, prefer mysql
<brandonj> postfix is notorious for being difficult
<naucs> qmail is pretty easy, secure, goofproof
<loulinkj7> does anyone know why the introspection, and glib packages suddenly
	    need unstable x86 use flags?  [13:23]
<oohy9n> naucs is there a easy tool for qmail like posfix has
<brandonj> loulinkj7: that's news to me
<oohy9n> refering to postfixadmin
<oohy9n> that online thing
<naucs> well, email is never goofproof
<khayyam> I am a longtime qmail user, and quite frankly postfix *is* less
	  complex
<naucs> khayyam: ok.  i see this stuff about db backends and it makes me wonder
									  [13:24]
<brian|lfs> hey naucs  or khayyam do you two know anything about a brother 4570
	    pritner and getting it to work in gentoo
<khayyam> brian|lfs: no, sorry ... no printer here
<naucs> brian|lfs: is it in the foomatic list?
<brian|lfs> I messed with Brother's drivers for 2 days they don't seem to work
	    finally resorted to older drivers for a 4070 made in 2000
<brian|lfs> no don't think so  [13:25]
<oohy9n> is qmail still maintained
<brian|lfs> my foomatic list seemed really small am I missing a package
<brian|lfs> also was going to try cups 1.6.1 but I got cock blocked by gentoo as
	    my friend put it  [13:26]
<naucs> oohy9n: not really.  it just does what it does.
<khayyam> oohy9n: qmail has some licencing that prevents people distributing it
	  patched ... but it is maintained, or rather patches are maintained
									  [13:27]
<naucs> you have to patch it if you want TLS, for example
<brian|lfs> I know its not listed on linuxprinting.org  [13:28]
<oohy9n> is postfix maintained?
*** s0ra_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as sora_h
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes, actively
<oohy9n> alright, what about spam protection?
<oohy9n> i know about spam assasin, but postfix also has some spam protection as
	 well right?  [13:29]
<khayyam> oohy9n: what kind?
<oohy9n> mail
<oohy9n> not attachment
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes, obviously ... but do you mean no recieve for non-existant
	  users, etc?
<oohy9n> its fine, i will google the little details, sorry to question  [13:30]
<khayyam> oohy9n: RBL intergration?
<oohy9n> no no  [13:31]
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<Vodka`Vlad> ack. ok so i made a custom kernel (no biggie) and added a build tag
	     (rtlbuild) and now it seams I can not load modules (my build tag is
	     mmc for when i made my richo mmc modules)
<naucs> it uses a mail filter plugin architecture
<Vodka`Vlad> is this a known thing? its all the same bas kernel, just
	     enabling/building modules
<oohy9n> and qmail?
<naucs> Vodka`Vlad: did you do make modules && make modules_install ?  [13:32]
<Vodka`Vlad> naucs: yes, the issue is FATAL: Could not load
	     /lib/modules/3.3.8-gentoommc/modules.dep: No such file or directory
<Vodka`Vlad> when instead of mmc it is now rtlbuild
<khayyam> oohy9n: qmail will need patched for certain features
<Vodka`Vlad> i am /booted/ to the mmc kernel, not the rtlbuild kernel, but they
	     are the same kernel just i build the modules and changed the name
									  [13:33]
<khayyam> oohy9n: netqmail comes will quite a number, but again it depends on
	  the specific features your looking for
<naucs> Vodka`Vlad: well mikey doesn't like that
<loulinkj7> does anyone know why the introspection, and glib packages suddenly
	    need unstable x86 use flags?
<oohy9n> khayyam just a simple spam filter  [13:34]
<khayyam> oohy9n: like procmail?
<oohy9n> i dont want any of those mail order brides, enchanment for males,
	 UNBELIEAVLE DEAls
<Vodka`Vlad> naucs: i see that. so i need to keep the build tag the same, or
	     reboot to the kernel that should be the same cept the name
<brian|lfs> ok I"m rebooting kernel installed and bootloader updated  [13:35]
<oohy9n> khayyam idk, i will stop with the questions and go look myself
<naucs> Vodka`Vlad: it seems you failed to install the modules for your old mmc
	build
<khayyam> oohy9n: ok, but this is just a extention of dot-forwared (or how the
	  user chooses to handle mail delivery)
<Vodka`Vlad> naucs: right, thats what im saying. I change the buildtag just to
	     keep a eye on what im doing, but thats not right it seams
									  [13:36]
<naucs> Vodka`Vlad: if you did it right, you would have 3.3.8-gentoommc modules
	dir, and 3.3.8-gentoortl modules dir
<Vodka`Vlad> naucs: did that right, but i thought about it wrong(ly)
<naucs> Vodka`Vlad: if you change the tag, rebuild the modules, install them,
	and they will go in a new modules dir  [13:37]
<Vodka`Vlad> right, and NOT be usable by this kernel if it is NOT matching the
	     tag
<Vodka`Vlad> even tho nothing there changed
<naucs> Vodka`Vlad: man modprobe if you really want to force load some module
									  [13:39]
<naucs> they're just trying to keep you from accidentally breaking your system
<Vodka`Vlad> nope i know how to do that, i just wanted to make sure I was seeing
	     the issue as the real issue since i did not see the tag correctly
<brian|lfs> I'm back  [13:40]
<brian|lfs> not sure what the lag was mounting my local file systems on my
	    reboot lol
<brian|lfs> no errors anywhere
<brian|lfs> maybe udev remapping stuff who lknows
<naucs> Vodka`Vlad: it is so you can have multiple versions of 3.3.8 installed,
	with different options, different modules, not all overwriting each
	other
<loulinkj7> does anyone know why the introspection, and glib packages suddenly
	    need unstable x86 use flags?  http://pastebin.com/NdUHjAuy
									  [13:41]
<Vodka`Vlad> naucs: yup, i see that now. i dunno why it wasnt obvious before,
	     likely vodka goggles
<naucs> ok, you owe me a shot
<brian|lfs> lol
* Vodka`Vlad sends naucs 3 shots and a white russian  [13:42]
<oohy9n> okay i feel a bit more informed  [13:43]
<khayyam> loulinkj7: because its a dependency of gnome-media
<brian|lfs> ah must be pulse music still skips
<oohy9n> so all i need is an mta, imap/pop server, mail filter, and something
	 like amivisd-new
<khayyam> loulinkj7: but actually there are a number of issues there ..  [13:44]
<oohy9n> right naucs or khayyam
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes, that sounds about right, I'd choose IMAP over pop ...
									  [13:45]
<oohy9n> i want imap :D
<oohy9n> pop would be great, i just dont need it to run like that
<khayyam> oohy9n: I might not have amavisd-new either as this generally just
	  tags things like spam  [13:46]
<cwalsh> I know there is a flag for emerge to have it not clean up the source
	 after it finishes compiling, but I can't find it for the life of
	 me. Any help?
<oohy9n> so what would be best then khayyam
<oohy9n> just use spam-assassin directly somehow?
<khayyam> oohy9n: well, even then its just tagging incase of false positives
	  ... I leave that to the users themselves  [13:48]
<oohy9n> khayyam let me pick an mta first, then i can see how things come
	 together
<oohy9n> khayyam so you have no spam protection?
<oohy9n> fact is maybe i am being paranoid, why would i except 200000 million
	 spam messages  [13:49]
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes, I do, but I leave it to the users, to impliment
<oohy9n> khayyam how do you do that?
<oohy9n> depending on mail client?
<oohy9n> i also want a webmail acess, and that is the main problem  [13:50]
<khayyam> oohy9n: no, as I said mail is delivered via .qmail or .forward and so
	  can be processes further (via procmail or what-have-you)  [13:51]
<tenX> oohy9n: sa-learn on specific imap folders?  [13:52]
<oohy9n> i see, and if i wanted a mail server capable of serving both to a
	 desktop-based mail client and a webmail server, what would you
	 recommend?
<khayyam> oohy9n: I don't provide webmail, and as clients go, as long as it can
	  imap then its ok  [13:53]
<tenX> oohy9n: same here, no webmail, but shouldnt it be based on imap?
<khayyam> tenX: that ok if its your mailbox, but you can't really do this for
	  others, because of false positives  [13:54]
<khayyam> tenX: I was speaking of sa-learn  [13:55]
*** soafee-chan (~spaec@unaffiliated/traumapony) is now known as spacekitteh
									  [13:56]
<tenX> khayyam: thought was to define user specific folders providing the
       ability for the user to sort ham and spam
<tenX> khayyam: so was i :)
<khayyam> tenX: right, but its not really the job of the mailserver/postmaster
	  ... at least I'm kinda warry of it  [13:57]
<`elsie> Alright, so trying to do an install and apparently it's not detecting
	 wlan0, I think it may be due to the physical switch being off but when
	 I press it it does nothing.
<brian|lfs> I would like to find the post master lol
<tenX> khayyam: yeah but you leave it to the users that way?  [13:58]
<brian|lfs> tell him to take the junk mail back lol
<khayyam> tenX: yes, but there are features if they choose to use them ...
									  [13:59]
<tenX> khayyam: features like?
<khayyam> tenX: like procmail
<oohy9n> so procmail would act as the server that serves mail to the client's
	 desktop app right?  [14:00]
<khayyam> oohy9n: no, only filter what gets delivered to the mailboxes and which
	  mailbox
<oohy9n> so wait procmail is instead of amavisd-new then?  [14:01]
<khayyam> oohy9n: procmail is just a mail delivery agent ... but it has regex
	  like filtering  [14:02]
<khayyam> oohy9n: so its more like a mail processor
<oohy9n> alright, also thanks for bearing with me here, i can see how truly
	 unprepared i am  [14:03]
<khayyam> oohy9n: no, no ... its really not that complex ... but otherwise, your
	  welcome
<`elsie> Anyone have any idea on how to turn on my wireless function for my
	 laptop? I'm trying to do a new install but when I press the physical
	 button it doesn't turn on.  [14:04]
<oohy9n> i feel like i should just go ahead and try setting a test up, and
	 adding whatever else i feel that it needs later
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes, thats a good approach
<tenX> oohy9n: you can also configure postfix filters like spamassassin without
       procmail
<jazzplayer> morning, i am away from any gentoo box to look it up myself.  can i
	     run kde-4.9.0 on <xorg-server-1.12 ?  [14:05]
<oohy9n> tenX i will try postfix and courier-imap now
<oohy9n> err
<khayyam> `elsie: do you have rfkill enabled in the kernel and
	  net-wireless/rfkill installed?
<oohy9n> quick question, how would i test if it worked
<tenX> oohy9n: i could recommend cyrus imapd
<tenX> oohy9n: dunno about courier-imap though
<tenX> oohy9n: but cyrus has always served me well  [14:06]
<oohy9n> alright i will look into it
<tenX> khayyam: ?
<khayyam> oohy9n: I prefer net-mail/dovecot  [14:07]
<khayyam> tenX: ?
<tenX> khayyam: your recommendation was my matter of interest ;)
<khayyam> tenX: oh ... ^^
<oohy9n> is courier-imap bad?  [14:08]
<tenX> no idea
<khayyam> oohy9n: 'bad' is somewhat subjective, theres also the question of
	  familarity, documentation, etc, etc
<oohy9n> alright  [14:09]
<oohy9n> it seems dovecot is a bit more popular than cyrus
<tenX> khayyam: why dovecot in three words
<khayyam> tenX: simplicity in one :)
<oohy9n> ohh dovecot has sasl auth, very nice
<`elsie> khayyam: Oops, sorry, didn't see you  replied, not using my normal IRC
	 client since I'm not on my own computer, anyways, I'm using the Gentoo
	 LiveCD so let me check
<tenX> khayyam: :) its often what you're used to  [14:10]
<khayyam> oohy9n: there is also mail-filter/dovecot-antispam if you choose to go
	  that route
<tenX> khayyam: why experiments if it works
<oohy9n> khayyam ohh so it has plugins?
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes
<oohy9n> alright postfix dovecot
<tenX> khayyam: damn you seem to be more credible  [14:11]
<oohy9n> and to serve desktop clients i would need nothing else right?
<khayyam> oohy9n: take a look at all the options before making any big decision
	  :)
<oohy9n> tenX not that, i am just a begginner, having a package with everything
	 seems easier
<tenX> oohy9n: all good :)  [14:12]
<khayyam> oohy9n: I don't know what you mean by 'desktop' clients ... its mail
	  ..
<oohy9n> just that google has about 5 times more results for dovecot vs cyrus
	 imapd
<oohy9n> khayyam something like thunderbird
<oohy9n> would you connect to postfix?
<tenX> oohy9n: maybe that because dovecot is causing 5 times more trouble ;)
									  [14:13]
<khayyam> oohy9n: the clients just speak IMAP so its client, and therefor
	  'desktop' neutral
<oohy9n> you never know tenX, you never know :)
<tenX> oohy9n: the MTA is delivering the mail  [14:14]
<`elsie> Alright, khayyam: Rfkill says there's no softblock for my wireless, but
	 there's a hardblock, I did rfkill unblock all but even pressing the
	 button I can't stop the hardblock.
<oohy9n> alright lets give this a try
<tenX> oohy9n: the IMAP server is storing it and making it available
<oohy9n> ohh btw important question
<tenX> oohy9n: to clients  [14:15]
<khayyam> `elsie: if there is a hardblock then its a hardware switch which is
	  disabling the card
<oohy9n> can dovecot store login info to database backend so i can serve a
	 webmail
<`elsie> khayyam: Yeah, which is the button on it but it doesn't change even
	 when I press it... hmm...  [14:16]
<`elsie> OH wait
<`elsie> LED just didn't change color when I pressed it, okay
<tenX> oohy9n: credentials must be stored somewhere
<khayyam> oohy9n: see the mysql useflag
<khayyam> oohy9n: you *could* use ldap, or mysql
<tenX> oohy9n: the database can even be a file  [14:17]
<oohy9n> true, but i would prefer a mysql database, for better integration with
	 a webmail client  [14:18]
<tenX> oohy9n: setting up a real dbms and hooking it up is also possible
<oohy9n> they seem to be quite picky
<khayyam> oohy9n: for so few users I wouldn't choose a mysql backend
<`elsie> khayyam, Weird, there's no softblock or hardblock anymore, but it's
	 still saying no such device for wlan0.
<tenX> khayyam: yeah, makes it more complicated if your new
<khayyam> `elsie: does the card show up in dmesg, or any sign of the modules
	  loading?
<oohy9n> khayyam i already have one up, so the mysqld process would not just run
	 for the mail  [14:19]
<oohy9n> also i dont need lighting fast mail
<oohy9n> atm
<khayyam> tenX: I also prefer it for virtuals, aliases, etc ... its generally
	  simpler and less trouble
<khayyam> oohy9n: its not just speed, but ease of use
<tenX> khayyam: yeah my setups dont need more as well  [14:20]
<oohy9n> right, but you guys dont need webmail as well
<oohy9n> right?
<khayyam> also you have something else that can go wrong in the mix
<khayyam> oohy9n: webmail is eeeeeeeevil  [14:21]
* khayyam laughs
<oohy9n> khayyam you are slowly and surely convincing me, along with your
	 partener tenX
<tenX> oohy9n: dont see the difference with webmail. might be another thing if
       the actual account administration is handled via web as well
<tenX> khayyam: and you're right  [14:22]
<oohy9n> tenX i dont think that would be needed, seems postfix has postfixadmin
<tenX> khayyam: i'd never want to run webmail as well
<oohy9n> sure its web, but i hope it does it through ldap
<JMichaelX> i am running into this, when trying to emerge world, could someone
	    tell what the best way would be to proceed?
	    http://pastebin.com/vpnS7k58  [14:23]
<tenX> oohy9n: console.
<oohy9n> tenX that would be solution b
<oohy9n> one which i am slowly tending towards
<khayyam> JMichaelX: you need to choose between the dhclient or dhcpcd useflag
<tenX> oohy9n: you should accelerate :>  [14:24]
<tenX> oohy9n: it'll save you trouble in the end
* oohy9n pushes the pedal to the metal xD
<`elsie> khayyam: I'm not sure what pattern I should narrow down to see if it
	 does show up.
<tenX> oohy9n: may be difficult at the beginning but definitely pays off
* khayyam covers ears awaiting loud crash 
<oohy9n> i assume i cant have ssmtp AND postfix?  [14:25]
<tenX> oohy9n: universal usage, way less security issues
<JMichaelX> khayyam: ty, i thought that was the case, but was unsure about what
	    it said about nss & gnutls, as well. would it be better to add this
	    to make.conf or in package.use?
<khayyam> `elsie: grep wlan0 or whaterver driver you expect the card uses (if
	  you know)
<tenX> oohy9n: no. one mta
<khayyam> JMichaelX: yes, similarly with nss gnutls  [14:26]
<tenX> oohy9n: of course
<khayyam> JMichaelX: sorry, I didn't actually read that far once I saw the first
	  cause
<oohy9n> khayyam so i need the dovecot-sasl flag right?
<JMichaelX> khayyam: not a problem. should i add this to my make.conf?
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes, for sasl (recommended)  [14:27]
<oohy9n> got it
<khayyam> JMichaelX: well, no need to make it global .. use
	  /etc/portage/package.keywords
<`elsie> khayyam: Yeah, did grep wlan0 but nothing returned, hmm, maybe it just
	 didn't load right the first time, I'll try a reboot
<khayyam> JMichaelX: correction /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
<tenX> `elsie: doesnt have to be wlan0  [14:28]
<JMichaelX> khayyam: ty! you saved me from asking another question. :)
<khayyam> JMichaelX: <category>/<package> useflag
<thens> in accept_keywords? shouldn't he set it for each package in his
	package.use file?  [14:29]
<khayyam> `elsie: ummm ... do you know the card, are perhaps driver?
<Aiox> umm hi  [14:30]
<khayyam> `elsie: no need to reboot .. it probably won't change anything
<khayyam> Aiox: hey
<Aiox> so, i want to install Gentoo on my G5 PPC
<tenX> `elsie: ifconfig -a  [14:31]
<tenX> `elsie: iwconfig
<naucs>  how about lspci?
*** s0ra_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as sora_h
<khayyam> Aiox: I'm a long time PPC user ... but sadly nolonger
<Aiox> is there any guide that is easier to follow than the 55 page guide?
<jazzplayer> please, does kde-4.9.0 work on xorg-server-1.11.4 ?
<naucs> Aiox: the 255 page guide is easier to follow but it takes longer  [14:32]
<khayyam> Aiox: the handbook is the recommended ... why would you want anything
	  less :)
<Aiox> darn
<`elsie> naucs: Ahh! Yeah, lspci had it show up.  Atheros AR9285
<Aiox> i'm on the 2008.0 PPC Networkless Handbook
<tenX> `elsie: that should be well supported
<tenX> iwconfig?
<naucs> `elsie: lspci -v should show driver if any is loaded  [14:33]
<Aiox> since i have no Ethernet nearby and my Wifi card doesn't seem to find my
       home network...
<Aiox> so anyways
<Aiox> i...can't really understand the partition part
<`elsie> tenX: first thing I tried, it doens't show up there
<khayyam> Aiox: you mean using mac-fdisk?  [14:34]
<Vodka`Vlad> so ive got the tag changed to match again, but modules.dep is not
	     being created??
<tenX> `elsie: okay, is the system up to date?
<naucs> so you don't have the driver.  you are on liveCD/DVD `elsie?
<`elsie> naucs: Doesn't look like any drivers or modules loaded.
<Vodka`Vlad> i have .builtin and .order
<`elsie> Yup, Gentoo liveCD
<Aiox> do i have to partition prior to booting on Gentoo UniversalCD
<Aiox> or do i partition during the process?
<tenX> `elsie: strange, forget this is gentoo chan ;)  [14:35]
<`elsie> Aiox: During
<naucs> `elsie: it's kind of bothersome having to type that backtick in front of
	your name  :/
<khayyam> Aiox: via diskutil? No, thats optional
*** `elsie (~Administr@24-116-154-57.cpe.cableone.net) is now known as way2lewd
<tenX> `elsie: atheros is usually well supported
<Aiox> G5 would be in this case a New World?
<way2lewd> naucs,  There :P
<khayyam> Aiox: yes, G5 is new world
<naucs> oh my
<Aiox> so, let's see, say i got around what...5 GB free space on my HDD  [14:36]
<Aiox> o]
<Aiox> woops, wrong typing
<Vodka`Vlad> any ideas on what would cause modules.dep to not be built when the
	     kernel and modules are make'd ?
<tenX> way2lewd: could the interface be down? looks like iwconfig goes for up
       devs
<Aiox> around how much space should i give for each Linux partition?
<way2lewd> tenX: Do you mean the ip link set wlan0 up command? If so I tried
	   that.  [14:37]
<khayyam> Aiox: you intend to dual boot? Why only 5GB?
<Aiox> yeah Dual Boot
<Aiox> 20GB would be better i suppose?
<khayyam> Aiox: yes, much better
<Aiox> random number i threw
<Aiox> so ok
<Aiox> say i got 20GB then  [14:38]
<khayyam> Aiox: but give some more ... if you have it
<tenX> way2lewd: lsmod | grep ath
<Aiox> 25GB?
<naucs> prob isn't any ar9285 driver on the cd
<khayyam> Aiox: well, 20GB would be fine but, it depends on how much you plan to
	  install, use, etc
<Aiox> khayyam: ok then 30GB  [14:39]
<way2lewd> tenX: Yup, no return, should I try another CD? I also have an Arch
	   and #! CD lying around.
<tenX> way2lewd: well if there is no driver you could compile one
<tenX> way2lewd: but its live system right
<tenX> well i'd check if the card worked on knoppix live  [14:40]
<way2lewd> tenX: If you mean running of the live CD, then yeah, I haven't even
	   partitioned my drives yet.
<tenX> way2lewd: thats what i was expecting
<Aiox> i intend to do what i couldn't do in Mac OS X 10.5.8 PPC, what videos in
       Facebook (newest Flash Player needed) or at least get Wine or some random
       thing, something to let me bypass the limitations of the PPC, pre-intel
       mac (Khayyam)
<way2lewd> I wanted to set my wireless up for sure before I wiped anything as I

<khayyam> Aiox: ask Adobe :)
<tenX> way2lewd: basically i'd configure things via wpa_supplicant.conf
<khayyam> Aiox: wine is x86
<Aiox> so....? i can use it on gentoo?  [14:42]

<way2lewd> tenX: Shouldn't need it, the network is unprotected.
<tenX> way2lewd: can be migrated easily, but you of course need a device first

<Aiox> khayyam: what?  [14:43]
<tenX> way2lewd: what ath chipset was it?
<khayyam> Aiox: ppc is big endian
<way2lewd> Atheros AR9285
<khayyam> Aiox: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness
<khayyam> Aiox: so wine won't run as it can't emulate little endian  [14:44]

<way2lewd> tenX: Yeah, my lappy is about 5 or 6 years old now I'd say.
<Aiox> khayyam: meaning that Wine is big endian while PPC is little endian?
<khayyam> Aiox: visa-versa
<tenX> way2lewd: have u tried modprobe ath9k?
<Aiox> khayyam: so i'm stuck with my Flash Player 10.1.102.64?  [14:46]

<Aiox> khayyam: but seems my dreams are shattered, ain't them?  [14:50]
<naucs> way2lewd: the name of the driver is ath9k.  modprobe it?
<naucs> oh, lol... -^
<naucs> tenX said that

<oohy9n> Aiox you could look into lightspark  [14:51]

<oohy9n> i have been wanting to try that myself sometime

<oohy9n> it boasts agreeable youtube experience
<oohy9n> which is nothing, since youtube is quite nice
<Aiox> and in Microsoft Visual Studio, which means i have to download Ubuntu

<oohy9n> khayyam yes
<khayyam> oohy9n: virtual or system?
<oohy9n> virtual
<oohy9n> oops let me set it up for virtual first  [15:31]
<khayyam> oohy9n: you just use a virtual file
<oohy9n> it seems by default it does system am i right?
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes
<khayyam> oohy9n: there are no 'tools' to speak of  [15:32]

<khayyam> oohy9n: there are just flat files

<khayyam> oohy9n: there is no automatic method to do this ...  [15:49]
<oohy9n> right
<oohy9n> but from where do you do it
<oohy9n> /etc/postfix/vmailbox?
<khayyam> sajmon: the config will hold CONFIG_X86_64=y and so you really need to
	  re configure the kernel for CONFIG_X86_32  [15:50]
<sajmon> khayyam: yes but i cant find any switch for architecture, let me check
	 again  [15:51]
<sajmon> maybe its because build on 64bit system, and dev and proc r mounted
	 from 64 bit host
<khayyam> sajmon: no, I mean start from scratch ... I don't think there is one
	  simple change that will change all the 64 to 32  [15:52]

<sajmon> khayyam: darn, all right, i hate it...
<oohy9n> well i found a nice doc on virtual mailboxes

<oohy9n> khayyam so that is how they can change their pass
<oohy9n> :) lucky you
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes :)
<oohy9n> i also have to think of a way to do that nicely
<khayyam> oohy9n: there are plugins (mostly for webmail/squirelmail) that allow
	  this, but I'm not sure how it works with virtuals  [15:56]
<oohy9n> well webmails usually need a login databse
<oohy9n> :?
<oohy9n> *database  [15:57]
<oohy9n> but mebbe using the postfix cmd, password is changable

<oohy9n> well nothing
<tgary> khayyam: Thanks, I think I'll try grub2.

<khayyam> oohy9n: thats probably your cause
<oohy9n> http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html#virtual_mailbox
<oohy9n> i think virtual_mailbox_base replaces home_mailbox  [16:01]
<oohy9n> or at least the base
<khayyam> oohy9n: yes, no doubt ... then these mail will go to /var/spool/mail/
<oohy9n> this is quite similar to how i used to set up lighttpds
<oohy9n> khayyam i know /var/mail is a link
<khayyam> tgary: np .. yw
<oohy9n> is /var/spool/mail a problem?  [16:02]
<khayyam> oohy9n: it shouldn't be no ..
<oohy9n> mebbe the problem is permissions

<khayyam> ascendant: perhaps some clue here: http://linux-mm.org/OOM_Killer

<ascendant> lol i have that tab already open
<ascendant> i think all that does is similar to priorities that help oom-killer
	    choose which process to kill  [16:11]
<ascendant> but in this case i have no swap so my system just locks up if i run
	    out of ram  [16:12]
<ascendant> and i want to see if i can fix that without using swap

<khayyam> ascendant: me neither, but I can be used to group processes and
	  (afaik) limits
<ascendant> well, i know that i can limit the ram a process can allocate with a
	    cgroup, but i believe that the behavior this will apply i just
									  [16:17]
<ascendant> in my case, no swap = process gets ENOMEM and dies
<ascendant> or in cases with swap the rest gets allocated to swap
<ascendant> in this case, i'm running xz and having too much fun with the

<ascendant> so it eats all my ram and the system locks up
<khayyam> oohy9n: heard of yes, but never used
<oohy9n> khayyam right sorry  [16:19]
<ascendant> if i put it it in a cgroup, it will start generating an enormous
	    amount of i/o when it hits the limit (basically freezing the

<markand> my fonts are really large on my X terminals but my Xdefaults is

<hojuruku> markand: set your dpi to 90
<hojuruku> or 72 then everything gets smaller ;)
<markand> with Xft.dpy ?  [17:01]
<hojuruku> gnome-terminal lets you adjust the font. Do people still use xterm?
<markand> wait, it seems to only appears with urxvt not xterm :o
<khayyam> markand: with startx that would be: startx -- -dpi 100  [17:02]
<khayyam> markand: or whatever dpi you want to set
<markand> I think its not the problem, I use exactly the same font with xterm
	  and urxvt  [17:03]
<markand> but xterm got the "good" font width
<khayyam> markand: urxvt is unicode so that may explain it  [17:05]
<markand> but it always worked, mmm I removed some settings in .Xdefaults and

<khayyam> markand: maybe you have alt-font-width and unicode3 useflags?  [17:08]
<markand> http://markand.malikania.fr/shot.png look above is xterm and under is
	  urxvt
<markand> as you can see it take a little more spaces  [17:09]
<markand> with the same font setting
<markand> yes I have unicode3 but not alt-font-width
<khayyam> markand: well, there is about a 1pt difference  [17:10]
<markand> should I remove unicode3 ?  [17:11]
<khayyam> markand: well, just reduce the pixelsize by one pt ... I'm not sure
	  about uncode3 as I don't have it set  [17:13]
<markand> but it's the same size for both terms  [17:14]
<markand> I always used this .Xdefaults before, I just switched to gentoo and
	  noticed this problem
<khayyam> markand: yes, but they are rendering differntly, as urxvt is fully
	  unicode, while xterm not
<markand> but it worked on FreeBSD, ubuntu and so on :p  [17:16]
<the_file> i get an error when compiling things  [17:17]
<the_file> it just says: "option -02 not recognized"
<the_file> maybe its my make.conf file?
<a3li> the_file: it's an uppercase O, not a zero.  [17:18]
<the_file> fuck
<a3li> also, mind the language
<khayyam> the_file: O (capital o) and not 0 zero
<the_file> thats not the first time fonts got me
<the_file> lol
<the_file> thanks
<the_file> i can't find the firmware in the kernel menu  [17:19]
<the_file> well for video cards
<the_file> all those .bin options are not in the kernel menu
<the_file> i did emerge radeon-ucode  [17:20]
<the_file> and emereged the kernel sources agian but its stil not ther
<the_file> *not there
<the_file> ehh  [17:21]
<the_file> the menu is not sorted by alphabetical order
<khayyam> the_file: the in kernel firmware and /lib/firmware are different
	  animals
<the_file> khayyam: aha
<the_file> i found my firmware
<the_file> ther are serverl modules for each card  [17:22]
<the_file> radeon
<the_file> do i just load all those modules with the name of my card?
<khayyam> the_file: not sure what you mean  [17:23]
<the_file> khayyam: I have an ati card
<the_file> khayyam: and I need to load the firmware, but are those .bin files
	   kernel modules?  [17:24]
<the_file> cause i tried insmod and its not liking them
<khayyam> the_file: no, the modules use/aquire the firmware
<chithead> insmod/modprobe is only for .ko
<the_file> oww
<tenX> khayyam: yeah they must be placed in certain paths i think
<the_file> khayyam: so xorg will grab the right firmware when loaded?  [17:25]
<the_file> i guess its not a kernel thing
<tenX> the_file: probably the driver
<the_file> oww
<khayyam> the_file: they are firmware loaded when the kernel driver is loaded
<the_file> got it
<the_file> thanks guys
<khayyam> the_file: yw  [17:26]
<the_file> back to compiling xorg
<the_file> khayyam: er
<the_file> khayyam: err
<the_file> whats did you average?
<the_file> on compile time for xorg
<khayyam> the_file: how long is a peice of string :)
<the_file> don't get it  [17:27]
* the_file string can be long
<the_file> or short
<khayyam> the_file: exactly, so processor can be powerfull or not
<the_file> got it
<the_file> I thought you were going in that direction  [17:28]
<the_file> khayyam: for a quiad core makes opts is normaly 5 right?
<the_file> *quad core
<the_file> not a server cpu
<khayyam> the_file: generally one per core
<the_file> thought it was 1 per core and 1 for the processor  [17:29]
<the_file> got it
<tenX> khayyam: but virtual cores count as well dont they  [17:30]
<khayyam> tenX: whats a virtual core?
<khayyam> tenX: hyperthread?
*** Kripton (kripton-fr@staff.kripserver.net) is now known as kripton  [17:32]
<tenX> khayyam: yeah
<tenX> not sure about the term
<khayyam> tenX: not sure, afaik hypertheads shouldn't be counted, just the CPU's
<tenX> khayyam: use a conf including them  [17:33]
<khayyam> tenX: I think becuase they are treated differently from SMP
<tenX> khayyam: good performance, no issues
<tenX> khayyam: the cores are in cpuinfo, even on virtualization hosts  [17:34]

	  prefered/recommended for BFQ

<tenX> cant look it up right now
<khayyam> tenX: but I think only pentium4 have hyperthreading  [17:36]
<tenX> i should test it
*** sandman (~quassel@static.21.38.9.176.clients.your-server.de) is now known as
    Sandman-Slayer  [17:37]
<khayyam> tenX: its not really an area I know alot about
<tenX> but pentium4 with more than one hw phys core?
<tenX> khayyam: me neither, really
<khayyam> tenX: I think hyperthreading pre-dates cores  [17:38]
<tenX> only tend to do research when it affects my systems
<tenX> pre-dates?
<tenX> making sure the info is already there?  [17:39]
<Vinky> HT makes 2 logical from one physical core
<khayyam> tenX: yes, it was the last of the p4 archectual design before being
	  abandoned for core2
<khayyam> Vinky: thank you :)
<tenX> khayyam: from what i read up they have at least own hw registers  [17:40]
<khayyam> Vinky: but its only P4 correct?
<TomWij> khayyam, tenX: I use "-j -l 7" (similarly --jobs --load-average 7),
	 where 7 is "VIRTUAL CORES -1".
<tenX> and optimized pipelining
<Frigolit> P4 had crappy hyperthreads, these have been far improved, and call
	   them threads not "logical cores" :P
<tenX> TomWij: ah what is -l?
<TomWij> tenX: Load average.  [17:41]
<Vinky> khayyam, no, intel have them on core iX and atom  too
<tenX> TomWij: balancing the stuff?
<TomWij> If this were a highway with 8 lanes (virtual cores), it would try to
	 keep 7 lanes filled; giving some room such that I can still use my
	 computer.
<tenX> TomWij: i understood about that  [17:42]
<TomWij> tenX: Yeah, tries to reach the average load you spceify instead of
	 trying to keep X jobs.
<Vinky> Frigolit, hehe maybe better that way
<Frigolit> Vinky: it's what they actually are so :) even though they aren't full
	   threads, just supportive threads which prepare the pipeline for the
	   main thread (you always have at least one thread per core)
									  [17:43]
<Frigolit> the Sparc T2 processor for example has 8 cores with 8 full threads
	   per core, making it 64 threads in total  [17:44]
<khayyam> Vinky: ok, so when they speak of core2, i7, etc, they are speaking of
	  hyperthreading?
<tenX> TomWij: okay but basically that doesnt have anything to do with the core
       issue itself, right? that sounds as if the preference is to balance out
       but on 7 cores, not paying regard wether they are virtual HT or physical
<Vinky> khayyam, eh what?  [17:45]
<TomWij> tenX: What core issues are you (or him) experiencing?
<khayyam> Vinky: I'm tryin to understand the vernacular :)
<TomWij> I just feels it works out better, because sometimes a job runs more
	 heavy or less heavy. So sometimes 2 jobs fully saturate, other times
	 10...
<Vinky> khayyam, core2 doesnt have HT AFAIK  [17:46]
<TomWij> 2 is maybe low, more like 4, but that's the idea of how load averaging,
	 to fully saturate.
<needle> just a quick question, is the ipv6 enabled by default in all profiles?
<khayyam> Vinky: ok, so its a different architectural design ... i see
<needle> ipv6 USE flag
<tenX> TomWij: no "issue". we were wondering how linux considers HT cores. they
       show up as physical once i think in cpuinfo and on virtualization hosts
<TomWij> needle: /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/make.defaults:USE="berkdb
	 crypt ipv6 ncurses nls pam readline ssl tcpd zlib"  [17:47]
<khayyam> needle: I think its set for all profiles ... yes
<TomWij> No other results found, so seems enabled by default.  [17:48]
<tjen> Hej. I have a small question: is it possible to add extra files (e.g. a
       portage snapshot) to a bootable USB drive (I use a minimal installation)?
<needle> tenX TomWij thx
<TomWij> tenX: Yeah, cpuinfo shows the HT ones. It shows 8 for me  [17:49]
<tjen> It seems I have to add those extra files to image.squashfs.
<tenX> TomWij: exactly and -jl7
<Vinky> tjen, should be possible after writing the iso to the usb drive
<TomWij> tjen: Yeah, you can append / adjust the USB drive. It doesn't break it
	 unless you tamper with a part of the boot / load sequence.
<tjen> I've copied the files to the USB drive but I failed to find 'em. Thanks
       for the heads-up, Vinky, TomWij, I'll give it another go.  [17:50]
<Vinky> tjen, you can add it to the usb directly, you dont need to touch the
	squashfs
<TomWij> tjen: Well, it can be handy to have them in there, although I suppose
	 it might be possible to access the USB itself as well.
<tenX> TomWij: so you should handle them as full ones
<TomWij> tjen: See in /media or /mnt if the USB appears.
<tenX> TomWij: for my observations
<TomWij> If not, figure out how you can mount the USB.  [17:51]
<tjen> TomWij the device is mounted as /mnt/cdrom, but tha doesn't exist. That's
       the problem. Hence I thought I'd force it to / by adding it to .squashfs.
<tjen> Anyway, I'll give it another try. Thanks!

	  ?
<mingdao> Cyb3r-Assassin: See what that outputs.
<Cyb3r-Assassin> ok ill try it  [22:23]
<mingdao> Cyb3r-Assassin: And which fwbuilder version do you have?  [22:24]
<Cyb3r-Assassin> Installed versions:  5.1.0.3599
<Tutsunacan> trying in #gentoo-apache but figure I'll try here as well any one

		 system and trying to build my own do my life box so I can use

<Cyb3r-Assassin> right my box is gentoo  [22:36]
<mingdao> Cyb3r-Assassin: I can recommend http://sistemas.ifc.edu.br/efg-1.17/
	  but have never used fwbuilder. If you enter your info in that page,
	  then you can generate an iptables firewall.
<Cyb3r-Assassin> its working  [22:37]

<Cyb3r-Assassin> it is kinda nifty looking app too  [22:38]
<mingdao> elog "You need to emerge sys-apps/iproute2 on the machine that will
	  run the firewall script."
<mingdao> But it didn't say to "rebuild" iproute2. Did you already have iproute2
	  installed?
<Cyb3r-Assassin> mingdao: I am sure I did. But I reemerged all that stuff and
		 its working.  [22:39]
<mingdao> Cyb3r-Assassin: If the log didn't say to "rebuild iproute2", then that

<mingdao> sharp15: At least start looking in /lib64/udev/rules.d/  [22:59]
<naucs> mingdao: once i thought i might like option of plugging this machine

<ssuominen> udev works in terms of /lib/udev not /lib64/udev  [23:00]
<ssuominen> and lately /usr/lib/udev

<ssuominen> on some systems
<mapee> hi
<ssuominen> package installing rules to /lib64/udev/ instead of /lib/udev/ is
	    broken and not respecting udevdir: echo `pkg-config
	    --variable=udevdir udev`/rules.d  [23:02]
<mingdao> ssuominen: Correct, sorry. I shouldn't answer only according to my

<sharp15> mingdao: not yet.  i started in /etc/ but wasn't sure what created the
	  *-persistent-cd.rules file.  [23:03]
<naucs> ssuominen: there shouldn't be rules in /lib or /lib64  [23:04]
<mingdao> ssuominen: Actually I have /lib/udev/ and /lib64/udev/ and nothing
	  seems to be a symlink except udev-acl

<mapee> i have stable x86 install with gentoo-sources 3.3.8 and it fails booting

	ago...https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12520  [23:05]
<naucs> mingdao: ls -ld /lib;  file /lib
<naucs> mingdao: anyway, i noticed your comment not to firewall with iptables.
	you mean that is it easier just to use a hardware router?
<Patagonicus> …and my console doesn’t show up using radeon. I even passed
	      nomodeset radeon.modeset=0 which worked with grml. Stupid iMacs :/
									  [23:06]
<mingdao> naucs: I use a gateway and managed switch on this LAN, rather than an

<mapee> btw "stable" kernel -.-"
<naucs> mapee: did you break grub possibly?  there was a recent upgrade with lib
	changes  [23:11]
<funfool> mapee, what happens after booting kernel in your pastebin, does it
	  freeze or drop you to a busybox shell?  [23:12]
<mapee> i use 0.97 "stable" grub
<naucs> mapee: do you have other kernels in /boot that boot?
<mapee> funfool, freeze
<mapee> naucs, nope
<naucs> mapee: yes 0.97 is that recent upgrade iirc
<mapee> yesterday it was fine
<Cyb3r-Assassin> nmap just gets ur ip banned by the hardware theirs no point in
		 it
<naucs> 0.97-r12
<mapee> was there an update since?
<naucs> mapee: so what did you do last to break it?
<mapee> yesterday i did a fresh install and i did one today too  [23:13]
<mapee> yesteday's install works fine, today's doesn'T boot
<mapee> *worked  [23:14]
<naucs> mapee: fresh install?  you erased everything in your partitions and
	reinstalled gentoo?
<mapee> naucs, yes
<mapee> just base system  [23:15]
<mingdao> mapee: Can you post your grub.conf and the output of "ls -l /boot" ?

<clod89> how do i enable XDMCP? i've read i need to enable

									  [23:17]
<mapee>  mingdao boot from installer and chroot?
<funfool> mapee,  may as well, will need to in order to fix it
<mingdao> mapee: Yes, to give the information and fix the problem of your Gentoo
	  system.  [23:18]
<mapee> ok
<mingdao> mapee: It's difficult for us to just guess what might be wrong, and if
	  your kernel won't decompress you can't boot it.
<mingdao> mapee: Are you using an initrd image there?
<mapee> mingdao, no i think i am not  [23:19]
<mapee> give me 5 mins pls
<mingdao> mapee: I'm about to have to leave, but others here can help.  [23:20]
<mapee> mingdao, ok, thanks
<naucs> mapee: did you build a different kernel than last time?  [23:23]
<mapee> naucs, no
<mapee> naucs, its the same
<naucs> you had your .config file saved  [23:24]
<clod89> anyone knows how to enable xdmcp? the only thing i could find is an old
	 wiki-archive article which is outdated and of no use
<mapee> ls -l /boot: boot -> .   ;  grub  ; kernel-3.3.8-gentoo-r1  ; lost+found

<xmw> clod89: sry, i read dpms.
<mapee> grub.conf: https://pastee.org/g3ysv
<naucs> mapee: maybe you didn't copy the compressed kernel  [23:30]
<mapee> naucs: you mean: cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/kernel-3.3.8-gentoo-r1 ?
									  [23:31]
<mapee> i did this
<clod89> even on this
	 http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/XVNC_Server#Login_manager_.28XDMCP.29
	 newer wiki article to enable xdmcp it  says to edit files that are not
	 there (i don't think i should create them myself)
<naucs> that sounds like a fail mapee
<naucs> let me check
<mapee> naucs, handbook fails then
<naucs> mapee: ok, you copied the bzImage.  nvm.  next q...  you have a 32 bit
	cpu?  [23:32]
<mapee> yep  [23:33]
<mingdao> cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage    is correct
<xmw> clod89: DisplayManager.requestPort: 0 looks like XREssources syntax.
<mingdao> mapee: what does "file /boot/kernel-3.3.8-gentoo-r1" output?
<xmw> clod89: echo "fuu: bar" >> ~/.Xresources ; xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources ;
      xrdb -query | grep fuu  [23:35]

<mingdao> DemonWitch: I'd backup valuable data and install a new drive.  [23:55]
<TomWij> Searchable online file/package database for Gentoo, e-file tells you

<mingdao> DemonWitch: It has bad sectors already.

<clod89> TomWij: well e-file xdm-config says that x11-apps/xdm should create the

	 is not installed?
<mapee> nawks, it seems fine :(  [23:57]
<DemonWitch> mingdao, how you figured it has bad sectors?
<DemonWitch> because of the read raw data errors?
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Reading the output.

<mingdao> and what nawks posted
<DemonWitch> reallocated sectors mean their previous position was failing?
									  [23:59]
<clod89> TomWij: i see. kind of confusing though i thought they were related
	 having the same name
<mapee> mingdao, should i try emerge genkernel?
<mingdao> DemonWitch:
	  http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=113&sid=3&lang=en
	  ... iirc that will give you a RMA if it's under warranty
<mingdao> mapee: I don't use genkernel myself ... why do you ask?

[Sun Aug 26 2012]
<mapee> mingdao, dunno just asked  [00:00]
<nawks> DemonWitch: yes, it marked 297 sectors as bad and used spare sectors to
	replace them
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Every hard drive (modern era) has unallocated sectors, so
	  it can move bad sectors out of the way. Failure is imminent
	  ... replace the drive.
<nawks> DemonWitch: you've probably already lost data that was on those sectors
<DemonWitch> nawks, 297 are many?  [00:01]
<mingdao> mapee: Just use a kernel-seeds .config for that kernel and get your
	  drivers from "lspci -nnk" compiled in, plus the fs drivers.
<DemonWitch> what percentage of the hdd is that?
<nawks> DemonWitch: it's kind of a lot.  not enough for WD to automatically fail
	it.  Do you want to test it more?
<mingdao> DemonWitch: You're going down in flames soon ... ATA Error Count: 42
	  (device log contains only the most recent five errors)  [00:02]
<nawks> not enough for *SMART to automatically fail it
<mingdao> better said ;)
<DemonWitch> nawks, thing is whatever i try to do that uses the hdd in some way
	     (open firefox, open some files etc) takes forever. now even boot
	     takes forever while the hdd remains on
<TomWij> clod89: xdm loads xdm by default, which is why I guess it is named like
	 that. I suppose they just reused that loader by introducing that famous
	 configuration line where you can for instance specify gdm and *magic*
	 they now don't have to write a gdm loader anymore... :D
<mingdao> But if it's under warranty, DATA Lifeguard will fix you up.
<nawks> DemonWitch: that's it spending time trying to read the bad sectors
<mingdao> DemonWitch: And they should have a bootable ISO for checking your
	  drive.
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Stop using it, backup the data, and replace it.  [00:03]
<DemonWitch> nawks, so there must be more bad sectors than those replaced
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Or you're going to loose more/all of your data.
<DemonWitch> mingdao, i have no data
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Do you have another computer?
<mapee> mingdao, what's the difference between kernel-seeds .conf and
	genkernel-all .config? the later compiles almost every stuff in and
	autodetect, right?
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Then just put a new drive in and install Gentoo fresh!
<nawks> DemonWitch: yes, that is what those latest errors in the log are telling
	you...  88 unreadable sectors (UNC - uncorrectable) if i'm reading it
	correctly  [00:04]
<mingdao> mapee: idk genkernel
<DemonWitch> nawks, and those cant be replaced by spares?
<nawks> they can, but that data is lost
<mingdao> DemonWitch: I make a good deal of money dealing with this every
	  day. Replace the drive.
<nawks> you can get a few bad sectors from power failures and the drive is not
	actually bad.  but 297 is way too many.  [00:05]
<W0rmDr1nk> what happened to silc-client ?  [00:06]
<DemonWitch> nawks, well i have some problems with heat in this laptop and also had electricity
	     failures
<DemonWitch> maybe those cause the hdd to fail
<DemonWitch> cause its a year old only
<mingdao> DemonWitch: You still have warranty on the drive. Go here:
	  https://westerndigital.secure.force.com/WarrantyCheck?lang=en and put WX11A61X5787 in the
	  form with your country. <:-)}  [00:07]
<DemonWitch> (also the heat caused emergency shoutdowns sometimes)
<mingdao> idk what country Mars would be ...
<mingdao> DemonWitch: electricity failures without a doubt  [00:08]
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Don't you leave the battery in the laptop?
<DemonWitch> mingdao, its dead
<DemonWitch> mingdao, but i got shutdowns because of high temperatures as well  [00:09]
<nawks> DemonWitch: you might want to run the extended self-test to gather more data to show its bad
<DemonWitch> which overrides the battery anyway

<ViruSzZ> hey guys whutz up? i was wondering if there's some gentoo way to automaticallyt recompile

<ViruSzZ> thanks, nice. didn't know that it exists...  [00:14]
<mingdao> DemonWitch: You should take the laptop in for warranty, if it has it; and if not, to a
	  qualified repair shop to get (a) new battery, (b) heat issues solved.
<DemonWitch> mingdao, btw if i get a new hdd and it fails again for some reason, can i still return
	     it?  [00:15]
<DemonWitch> or the warranty ends
<mingdao> DemonWitch: More than likely, but do what I wrote.
<mingdao> DemonWitch: At the present time with overheating you are in danger of burning some chips
	  on your motherboard; southbridge especially.
<ViruSzZ> i guess the right way would be to compile the new kernel, change the symlink to the newly
	  compiled one and then rebuild the nvidia module against the new kernel.  [00:16]
<DemonWitch> mingdao, actually my motherboard got burned
<ViruSzZ> will try that in the next upgrade
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Electrical problems are killer for computer hardware. You simply must get a
	  new battery, or use an UPS.
<DemonWitch> mingdao, but i did some reflowing and it worked
<mingdao> DemonWitch: What? How?
<DemonWitch> mingdao, baked
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Well, you can scratch any possible warranty on the mobo if you soildered
	  it. ;)
<mingdao> soildered (sp)
<DemonWitch> mingdao, well i send the laptop at a repair shop and they said i needed new fan, new
	     thermal new whatever  [00:17]
<mingdao> DemonWitch: That could very well be what killed your battery. ;)  11:08:52< DemonWitch>
	  mingdao, its dead
<DemonWitch> the laptop is 4 years old, its not worth it
<DemonWitch> i will just get the new hdd and try to use the laptop lightly
<mingdao> DemonWitch: How then does the hard drive have warranty until 07/19/2014?
<DemonWitch> mingdao, new hdd  [00:18]
<DemonWitch> the old died
<mingdao> DemonWitch: When?
<funfool> ViruSzZ,  once you finish building new kernel, emerge nvidia-drivers will build for new
	  kernel while still booted in old kernel
<DemonWitch> i got it last year
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Did you get it from WD?
<mingdao> DemonWitch: So 3 years as I expected.
<DemonWitch> mingdao, i used to use this laptop for hardcore gaming
<DemonWitch> and it just couldnt take it
<mingdao> ViruSzZ: As funfool said, you can do it now.
<ViruSzZ> it's ok now. yesterday there was an update of the kernel but I rebooted and was not able
	  to get into X. however reemerging nvidia drivers did the trick.  [00:19]
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Ok. Well, get the new hard drive. The repair shop said you new (a) new exhaust
	  fan, (b) new thermal compound on CPU/GPU.
<ViruSzZ> ok thank you anyway. Now I know I can build them while using the old kernel.
<mingdao> ViruSzZ: Okay, well, put that info in your ~/Gentoo-FAQ file. ;)  [00:20]
<ViruSzZ> its already there :D
<mingdao> ViruSzZ: Good on yah!
<mingdao> s/new/need  [00:21]
<funfool> wish I had a dime for every time booted to black screen because forgot to build the
	  drivers   ;)
<mingdao> DemonWitch: You can try using some dry air to blow dust/debrise out of the fan area of
	  your laptop. And use GKrellM or some other desktop system monitor to check your temps.
											      [00:22]
<DemonWitch> mingdao, should i try to get the warrantied hdd from that link or should i go at a shop
	     that works for WD here?
<mingdao> DemonWitch: emerge sys-apps/lm_sensors
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Never been to Greece, so not sure how that would work. I'd check the shop
	  where I bought the drive first.  [00:23]
<mingdao> DemonWitch: WD in the US will give you a RMA number from that test, and then UPS will pick
	  the old drive up and deliver the new drive.
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Definitely run the WD drive test *first* even if you go to a local shop.
											      [00:24]
<mingdao> DemonWitch: Windows users/techs might not take smartctl output seriously; but the WD test
	  tools will be familiar to them.
<funfool> seagate, pay $10 and they ship new drive and shipping label and use packaging to return
	  old drive  [00:25]
<DemonWitch> mingdao, well i cant run the wd tool because i cant even boot to windows right now
<mingdao> DemonWitch: We better leave this convo for now, it's really OT in this channel. If you
	  want ot ask more, try the guys in #hardware.
<DemonWitch> it takes forever and the hd doesnt respond
<mingdao> funfool: Seagate sends the new drive *first*? For only $10?  [00:26]
<funfool> they did for me, included the return postage for ups
<mingdao> funfool: Now you see how much $ they have in that drive. ;)  [00:27]
<funfool> they had my credit card # in case I did not return
<mingdao> okay  [00:28]

<phlux> Well, updating  [01:19]
<SkunkyFone> phlux: that's up to you.  just because there's a new kernel version doesn'tmean you

<coin3d> hey guys, is make oldconfig really that bad? the gentoo kernel upgrade guide recommends not
	 to use it  [01:26]
<PhotoJim> coin3d: make oldconfig works well if you're incrementally upgrading from one version to a
	   new version not too much newer.  [01:27]
<PhotoJim> coin3d: works well for me on my sparc64 system.  I use it all the time.  probably
	   slightly harder to use on i386/amd64 systems - more new options.
<coin3d> PhotoJim: well, i guess from 3.3.8 to 3.4.9 is a large step, huh? :D  [01:28]
<phlux> Looks like I'm making the same move, coin3d  [01:29]
<phlux> Nervous :\
<mingdao> coin3d: Not so large you can't use "make oldconfig" ... "make silentoldconfig" even. There
	  will be just a lot of new questions to answer.
<PhotoJim> coin3d: fairly far :) I'd probably make menuconfig for that big of a change.  but try
	   oldconfig.  if you find it too complex, just copy your old .config in again and do
	   menuconfig or xconfig.
<PhotoJim> mingdao: what does make silentoldconfig do?  just assume default answers to all the new
	   config options?
<coin3d> didn't know that silendoldconfig exists  [01:30]
<mingdao> coin3d: You can "eselect kernel list" then "eselect kernel set *" where * is the new
	  version you want; then "cd /usr/src/linux && make oldconfig" and it will use the .config
	  of your running kernel.
<PhotoJim> just remember guys, as long as you don't blow away your old kernel config and your old
	   kernel, you can always go back.  all you can destroy is time.
<mingdao> PhotoJim: They're all explained in /usr/src/linux/README
<mingdao> PhotoJim: Maybe you can't blow away your old kernel .config. So long as you haven't
	  removed the kernel and still have it under /lib/modules/.  [01:31]
<PhotoJim> it would take work to blow away the old config, for sure.  [01:32]
<Harrold__> vmware or virtualox?
<mingdao> PhotoJim: The running one is stored in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/.config
<PhotoJim> oh, good to know.  I assumed theo nly copy was in /usr/src/linux-(oldversion)/.config
											      [01:33]
<mingdao> Harrold__: Could you make a complete sentence of that? Because otherwise, I'd answer
	  "qemu-kvm".
<Harrold__> mingdao: I would need to setup qemu-kvm first and that would take a while  [01:34]
<Harrold__> especially that my system is unstable
<coin3d> use libvirt + kvm  [01:41]
<coin3d> and then girt-manager as graphical tool
<coin3d> god damn i hate that osx auto correction
<a3li> yes, use libgirt  [01:43]
<nawks> mingdao: i believe you have to copy the .config file too  [01:46]
<mingdao> nawks: negative  [01:49]
<mingdao> nawks: try it ;)

<coin3d> sorry! :D

*** _needle (~needle@unaffiliated/needle) is now known as needle
<nawks> mingdao: how will it know where to grab the existing config from?  maybe you have to do make

*** z0TK| (~z0tk@unaffiliated/z0tk) is now known as z0TK  [01:52]
<nawks> coin3d: the guide says "A much safer upgrading method is to copy your config as previously
	shown, and then simply run make menuconfig. This avoids the problems of make oldconfig
	mentioned previously, as make menuconfig will load up your previous configuration as much as
	possible into the menu."  but it doesn't actually say what the problems are!  (unless you
	consider "you may be asked to produce answers" as a problem)
<mingdao> nawks: The problems there are that whatever defaults are in the new .config will be in
	  your .config; and you might not have wanted those options.
<Toothpick> can anyone help please? suddenly I cannot hear any sound and in my "alsamixer" i see
	    only 1 bar (master volume)  [01:53]
<nawks> mingdao: ah, brilliant... uses uname and config in /boot.  of course, make sure /boot is
	mounted
<nawks> mingdao: that's the problem with silentconfig, not oldconfig
<mingdao> nawks: Being an old timer at building kernels, I have assumed everyone puts their config
	  in /boot (make install) and is not askeered to mount /boot.  [01:54]

<mingdao> theannihilator: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=429590#c1  [01:58]
<theannihilator> mingdao: is it just easier to use unetbootin to create the live dvd on a usb
<jerry__> mingdao: http://pastebin.com/1Dv7CsGF
<mingdao> nawks: I ^C the first time, then mv /boot/config-3.3.8 /home/mingdao/test/ && make

<nawks> mingdao: oic, well then its just doing the same as make menuconfig because it can't find the

<mingdao> yup  [02:00]
<mingdao> jerry__: lunch, sorry
<theannihilator> mingdao: how would i install this patch?  [02:01]
<jerry__> mingdao: ok, thanks  [02:02]
<nawks> mingdao: i just read what silentoldconfig does... same as oldconfig with quieter output.  i
	had assumed the same as photojim about it
<nawks> mingdao: and i guess you're pointing out that README says nothing about making sure /boot is
	mounted  [02:03]
<nawks> that's a flaw for sure

<pgentoo> cool thanks  [03:00]
<mingdao> pgentoo: Just mask things at certain levels if need be ... run "eix-sync && emerge -aDjNuv

	  and with the a (ask) you don't have to pull the trigger. ;)
<pgentoo> cool  [03:01]
<mingdao> pgentoo: On certain boxen my udev hasn't been updated since the systemd mad and hostile
	  takeover, so =sys-fs/udev-181 is in /etc/portage/package.mask
<theannihilator> mingdao: still erroringout  [03:02]
<pgentoo> i didn't normally run depclean as part of my updates, as i think it hosed me at some point
	  on a bx.
<pgentoo> is that mandatory?
<mingdao> pgentoo: You can keep certain pkgs at a desired level on your box. You might not want to
	  get a new kernel ... just removed the kernel source you chose from /var/lib/portage/world
	  and emerge won't pull a new one.
<mingdao> pgentoo: Again, even with depclean I have "emerge -a --depclean", and a = ask
<mingdao> pgentoo: If it asks to remove something I don't want removed, I enter No and it all stops
	  until I start it over.  [03:03]
<Vinky> mingdao, ehm wouldnt that depclean the kernel sources?
<pgentoo> ok, for a sanity check.  :)
<mingdao> Vinky: Yes, of course I didn't add to put sys-kernel/vanilla-sources:3.5.1 in
	  /var/lib/portage/world
<mingdao> Vinky: thanks
<mingdao> pgentoo: Gentoo's emerge is powerful ... I almost never run it w/out p (pretend) or a
	  (ask).  [03:04]
<pgentoo> what about when a package says i need to run revdep-rebuild on some specific .so and then
	  delete it.  With the depclean and revdep-rebuild -i take care of that all at once?
<mingdao> pgentoo: Run it as normal user with p rather than a ... it will not do anything.
<Vinky> pgentoo, depclean wont remove the .so  [03:05]
<pgentoo> but leaving it there shouldn't hurt anything right?
<mingdao> pgentoo: That is usually done by: revdep-rebuild --library libudev.so.1
<mingdao> pgentoo: whatever the name of the library happens to be  [03:06]
<pgentoo> yeah, well the "revdep-rebuild -i" take care of all of those at once, or do you still need
	  tod o one by one with --library?
<mingdao> pgentoo: Sometimes you have to do revdep-rebuild --library < >
<pgentoo> ok, so dont' ignore those messages then. :)  [03:07]
<khayyam> pgentoo: defintely not :)
<Vinky> pgentoo, revdep-rebuild  without --library  will only take care of broken deps
<Vinky> if the old library is still there it's not a broken dep  [03:08]
<mingdao> pgentoo: I recently had to do "revdep-rebuild --library libudev.so.0" on a box.
<mingdao> pgentoo: I recommend: PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save"  [03:09]
<mingdao> PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES="warn error info log qa"
<mingdao> and emerge elogv ... then elogv will read those pkg logs for you
<mingdao> Nicely parsed and in chronological order of emerged pkgs.  [03:10]
<pgentoo> "emerge elogv" is a post upgrade step then?  [03:11]
<pgentoo> sorry  [03:12]
<pgentoo> just elogv?
<mingdao> emerge app-portage/elogv   whenever
<mingdao> Have those options in /etc/make.conf for those logs to be created.
<pgentoo> cool, will try that  [03:13]
<pgentoo> never heard of elogv, thanks
<mingdao> elogv is ncurses, btw ... elogviewer is gtk if you prefer
<mingdao> pgentoo: Here's an elogv screenie:  http://ompldr.org/vZjhrNg
<pgentoo> i'm on a ssh only box, so ncurses is fine.
<pgentoo> so taht just gives you a nice history of past upgrades?  [03:14]
<khayyam> pgentoo: you can also use PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save mail" to have these messages mailed
											      [03:15]
<pgentoo> interesting...
<khayyam> pgentoo: or rather both saved and mailed
<pgentoo> lots of options i never knew existed
<mingdao> khayyam: And set the mail up in /usr/share/portage/config/make.conf ?  [03:17]
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v doc|mobile
<khayyam> mingdao: no, I didn't need to ... if there is a local mail delivery it works just by
	  adding 'mail'
<mingdao> khayyam: Will have to give that a go...  [03:18]
<khayyam> and so a procmail rule could be added to parse for --library and you can flag that mail
	  (haven't done this myself ... but its possible)  [03:19]
<khayyam> mingdao: the mail is delivered to 'root' so you might also want to change
	  /etc/mail/aliases and asign mail for root to another account  [03:22]

<WeAreTheBorg> Hi. I have a question. If I merge the current stable networkmanager, I get something
	       like:
<WeAreTheBorg> One or more symlinks to directories have been preserved in order to ensure that files
	       installed via these symlinks remain accessible. This indicates that the mentioned
	       symlink(s) may be obsolete remnants of an old install, and it may be appropriate to
	       replace a given symlink with the directory that it points to.

<khayyam> pgentoo: yes ...  /etc/portage/patches/<category>/<package>[-<version>[-<revision>]] and
	  add your patch  [03:46]
<BlastHardcheese> Riley88: possibly because you're identifiying after you connect, and you wind up

<Riley88> im using nickserv for my password
<Riley88> my nick was identified then i joined #gentoo  [03:47]
<Riley88> using xchat btw
<Vinky_> xchat for instance is not waiting for nickserv  to identify before joining channels
<khayyam> pgentoo: you should see 'applying user patch' at patch stage
<pgentoo> can i copy the diff info from github, or need to grab the old and new versions of hte

	  work that way.
<latenite> mingdao, please I looked at all of then. I dont like any of them exect
	   "noallconfig"..thats my starting point
<mingdao> latenite: There is no such thing as "make noallconfig".  [04:32]
<latenite> khayyam, I know...I tried to solve the depens|select|if in the Kconfig files....but
	   parsing text is just very error prone. I cant get it to work nicely
<mingdao> latenite:  "make allnoconfig" perhaps?
<latenite> mingdao, sure there is...
<mingdao> latenite: It doesn't work that way, because some options turn off other options, which
	  only work with the kernel Makefile.
<latenite> mingdao, yes sorry it twisted it around  :D  [04:33]
<mingdao> latenite: No, there is not.
<mingdao> latenite: grep noallconfig /usr/src/linux/README
<khayyam> latenite: well, make *config is a solution to a the problem of how to deal with DEPEND
	  ... the .config is just the result, which is why "do not edit" is prepended to the file
											      [04:34]
<mingdao> latenite: Please read /usr/src/linux/Makefile
<latenite> mingdao, I dont see why I can use "make menuconfig"....go to -> fs -> ext4 and check it
	   as a module. BUt at the same time is "is said to be" impossible to automate this step?!
											      [04:35]
<mingdao> latenite: Automatically generated file; DO NOT EDIT.
<mingdao> latenite: Please read /usr/src/linux/Makefile

<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, thats experience for you.  You get it just after you really needed it
<EvilMachine> lol
<annihilator> lol  [06:10]
<annihilator> yea
<EvilMachine> NeddySeagoon: I prefer to get it in the form of lines cast into sheets of mashed

<NeddySeagoon> EvilMachine, :)
<EvilMachine> Even better if those sheets are dedicated as "manuals" of the fornicating kind. :P

<epitamizor> whats a good channel for general ip/networking concepts  [06:16]
<BlastHardcheese> ##networking maybe
<epitamizor> on freenode?
<BlastHardcheese> yes, unless you know of another one  [06:17]
<annihilator> lol
<annihilator> whats a good channel for cellphone tether with tun in gentoo  [06:18]
<colock> annihilator: any channel where you find people that know what 'tun' and 'bridge' are and
	 how to use them  [06:19]
<annihilator> lol  [06:20]
<annihilator> and gentoo
<colock> what about it?
<colock> the "right" way to bring it up?
<annihilator> cause i initiate the program and it reads the phone and the app
<colock> i guess you can start looking into /etc/conf.d/net or something like that
<annihilator> but the app is not reading the program
<colock> "reading" is a bit unprecise  [06:21]
<annihilator> its like there is a firewall
<colock> what do you mean by "reading" ?
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<annihilator> communication is one way
<colock> i.e. ping?
<annihilator> when it should be two way
<colock> tell me how you tested
<annihilator> tested?
<annihilator> there is no testing  [06:22]
<annihilator> its just running it lol
<annihilator> i used it in sabayon and mint lol but gentoo it aint workin
<funfool> annihilator,  sounds like you need a genkernel to get booted into system.
<annihilator> you compile the program
<annihilator> huh?
<annihilator> i dont need genkernel
<annihilator> funfool im booted
<funfool> and you have network  annihilator ?  [06:23]
<annihilator> well basic
<annihilator> wlan and eth
<annihilator> but i need to be able to tether wired through tun
<annihilator> clockworkmod tether
<annihilator> to be exact
<funfool> ok, you have made progress   :)  [06:24]
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator why do you need tun ?
<annihilator> cause that is what is used
<annihilator> i guess i need someone that is familar with tethering programs and gentoo then....
											      [06:25]
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator sounds odd.  tun is for virtual interfaces
<annihilator> yes
<colock> what is the interface?
<annihilator> which is perfect if you want to tether on an unrooted phone
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator  I just tether down USB
<colock> i see.
<annihilator> .....
<colock> so tun is on phone
<annihilator> yes
<colock> at least we know that
<annihilator> clockwork mod
<BlastHardcheese> then who was phone  [06:26]
<annihilator> tether utilizes program to app
<colock> it's like pulling out information with lot of patience
<annihilator> cause unless the phone is setup for tethering
<annihilator> you have to either root it or use an app
<colock> ok
<annihilator> and a my service does not allow tethering and b it dont have tethering unlocked by
	      default....
<colock> so on the host computer you do what? you run another program and then you have link between
	 two tun interfaces?  [06:27]
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, ok.  My phone just tehers
<annihilator> NeddySeagoon, your phone is setup to do it
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, yep
<annihilator> by a phone from verizon that they dont want you to tether with
<annihilator> or try to get it without payin a subscription
<annihilator> you cant the way you have it
<annihilator> and colock yes i run a program  [06:28]
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, verizon sounds like a forigen outfit
<colock> you run the program on host as root?  [06:29]
<annihilator> it uses adb to detect the phone
<colock> ok, so over usb
<annihilator> you compile it under the user then have to use root to run the script
<annihilator> yes
<annihilator> it uses usb debug
<colock> good  [06:30]
<annihilator> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.tether&hl=en
<colock> and what direction works?
<colock> and which one doesn't?
<annihilator> computer to phone works
<annihilator> the program launches the app and reads the phone is connected
<annihilator> but the phone cannot read the the program is running so the phone cuts the loop
											      [06:31]
<colock> can turn pages too? :D
<annihilator> lol
<annihilator> actually it will install the program if its not already installed
<colock> now
<colock> try with ping
<annihilator> ping dont read anything
<colock> what ip you see on the tun interfaces?
<annihilator> it sets up a 10.0.0.1
* colock tryes to guess what annihilator means with "read" but cannot find  [06:32]
<annihilator> lol
<colock> ok, and on the phone?
<annihilator> the phone says to run the program
<colock> it sure does :P
<annihilator> ....
<colock> we'll guess
<colock> ping 10.0.0.2
<annihilator> well i would say it would be a firewall
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v hasufell
<annihilator> but there is no firewall preinstalled
<annihilator> that im aware off
<colock> annihilator: if there is a firewall, you should know, no?
<colock> indeed.  [06:33]
<colock> so
<colock> is ping working?
<cK3n> #pentoo
<cK3n> sorry my mistake
<annihilator> i havent tried it yet i got stuck up in other stuff so i have not had a chance to

<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, what does route on the PC show ?
<colock> so you're seeking help and not ready to be helped.
<colock> wonderful
<colock> just wasting time
<annihilator> colock, i was seeing if anyone had advice on steps i had failed to miss actually
											      [06:35]
<colock> we're not magicians
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, answering questions helps
<annihilator> and pinging 10.0.0.2 i had not thought off but the question would then be asked how
	      would being a .2 address help if it gets staticed by the program
<annihilator> meaning the phone does not assign the ip address the pc program does  [06:36]
<annihilator> pinging*

*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v ABCD  [06:44]

<colock> you shouldn't be using gentoo annihilator...
<annihilator> colock, i know what i did
<annihilator> i was being a smart alec to NeddySeagoon
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, see what chithead said
<annihilator> after you posted i looked at logs and emerge --depclean removed gcc (all of them)
											      [06:46]
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, thats rare.  What does gcc-config 1   tell you ?  [06:47]
<redcheckers> that's an L not a 1 by the way
<annihilator> copy and paste
<NeddySeagoon> redcheckers, nopw, its a numeral 1  [06:48]
<annihilator> well... NeddySeagoon i did hose gcc
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, thats rare.  What does gcc-config 1   tell you ?
<annihilator> but it was cause im chrooted
<colock> oh my
<colock> can't see the end of it
<annihilator> let me try something
<annihilator> i had a similar problem

<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader, you can't.  Nout usfully.  Its partly in your kernel and partly in Xorg
<BTCTrader> hmm ok, i am 99% sure i have it built into my kernel  [06:56]
<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader You really don't want an xorg.conf file to start with unless you are using

<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, you should have 3.2 and 2.7
<annihilator> ok
<BTCTrader> i tried installing on a macbook air a couple days ago and that is going slowly too
<annihilator> then its gonna be a few hours then
<annihilator> cause i have to install android-sdk-update-manager  [07:15]
<NeddySeagoon> annihilator, those versions should be installed
<annihilator> yea 3.2 is
<annihilator> evdev vs synaptics? for xf86  [07:18]
<annihilator> evdev i see would work well but im curious if i can still do the three finger tap the
	      side and bottom scroll and all that with it
<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader in 3.3.5 Nouveau (nVidia) cards (NEW) is under  Staging drivers , so its
	       probably there in 3.3.8 too  [07:19]
<BTCTrader> hmm ok will take a look in a min
<BTCTrader> compiling syslog-ng *snooze*  [07:20]
<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader, mke it work first, make it better later
<BTCTrader> is it me or is my impression that gentoo hasn't evolved much from 2007 an accurate
	    statement?
<NeddySeagoon> build on what  you have  [07:21]
<BTCTrader> kk
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader, its much smoother than in 2007 but the install methods have not changed.

<khayyam> troii: it that a person?

<ivan> what did gentoofan do to you?
<troii> he ows me money
<BTCTrader> ok new issue, when i run modprobe nouveau i get back a lot of warnings about module not
	    found
<NeddySeagoon> troii, this is a gentoo help channel.  Please stay on topic  [07:41]
<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader, look in dmesg
<BTCTrader> all the warnings stem from files in the folder /lib/modues/3.3.8-gentoo etc
<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader, warnings or errors ?
<troii> so how come i was banned from the offtopic channel then?  [07:42]
<BTCTrader> hmm no errors in dmesg
<troii> reason "no bots allowed"
<NeddySeagoon> troii, thats offtopic here
<BTCTrader> i see a nvidiafb unknown arch
<colock> BTCTrader: check uname -r vs /usr/src/linux symlink
<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader, that should be off  [07:43]
<troii> well asnwer me in pm then
<BTCTrader> "module license nvidia taints kernel
<troii> i pmed you
<BTCTrader> lock debugging due to taint
<BTCTrader> oh  [07:44]
<BTCTrader> so uname is 3.3.8-gentoo and usr/src/linux is linux-3.3.8-gentoo
<BTCTrader> update grub with linux-3.3.8-gentoo?  [07:45]
<colock> BTCTrader: it uname is the same but you have recompiled kernel and changed things  [07:46]
<colock> well, you have to reboot
<colock> or try depmod -a
<colock> ;)
<BTCTrader> i rebooted already, the names of the kernel in both places is differnet  [07:47]
<NeddySeagoon> BTCTrader, you must remove nvidia-drivers
<BTCTrader> oh yup that could be an issue
<khayyam> BTCTrader: they are not different, you can ignore the 'linux-' part
<BTCTrader> back to menuconfig
<BTCTrader> oh ok
<colock> so, you should also make sure that the module you're looking for actually exist in
	 /lib/modules/3.3.8-gentoo/  [07:48]
<colock> but depmod -a && modprobe <modulename> should tell you
<colock> if you get errors like, invalid something when loading it, but the module is found, a
	 reboot is needed.  [07:49]
<khayyam> or modinfo
<colock> if it's not found, well, maybe you forgot make modules_install or you did not select that
	 module in menuconfig
<BTCTrader> ok
<colock> in any case, if trying to unload a graphic driver while in X might not be a good idea
											      [07:50]
<BTCTrader> ah i think you called it, i didnt run make modules_install
<khayyam> BTCTrader: that'll do it :)
<BTCTrader> my instructions i was going on didnt have that line
<john__> Hello, can anyone help me with an install question?  [07:51]
<BTCTrader> yes john  [07:52]
<annihilator> depends
<john__> I think it is due to me being a total n00b.
<annihilator> do you where depends dear john__
<john__> LOL
<annihilator> i was a new on installs till my 12th install yesterday
<annihilator> a total noob if you will
<annihilator> now im a noob on post installs  [07:53]
<BTCTrader> it literally does take 12 times to "get it" :)
<g33kN> Hi. I go to start postfix and it tells me /usr/lib64/postfix/postfix-script permission
	denied, but when I stat said file bout owner and group are postfix
<g33kN> any ideas what to try next? thx
<annihilator> sudo it LOL
<BTCTrader> hmm ok so same thing after a reboot
<john__> So I believe I followed the guide properly.  The issue is with booting into the
	 environment.  It appears to find the kernel through grub and then tries to initrd.  But it
	 just hangs.
<g33kN> annihilator: I'm running the init script...  [07:54]
<BTCTrader> modules not found
<annihilator> g33kN: i was joking
<BTCTrader> ignoring bad line in /lib/modules
<khayyam> g33kN: as root?
<g33kN> khayyam: sudo /etc/init.d/postfix start
<g33kN> only root can
<g33kN> was working just fine before I added sasl USE flag  [07:55]
<annihilator> john__: do you at least get a terminal prompt?
<g33kN> now I get this mumbo jumbo about usr/lib64/postfix permission
<john__> No.  It just blinks a cursor.
<annihilator> try crt+alt+f2
<khayyam> g33kN: hmmm ... I don't get this issue, what version of postix?
<annihilator> and tell me what happens
<john__> It literally just stops after it tells me the size and location of the kernel.
<annihilator> ah
<troii> http://pastebin.com/hzTUxqbV
<g33kN> 2.9.3 hardened  [07:56]
<annihilator> it sounds like a bad boot setup honestly did you setup fstab correctly?
<john__> I thought I did.
<BTCTrader> so any module i modprobe gives an error "ignoring bad line starting with /lib/modules/…"
	    :(
<g33kN> I even tried unmerging the package and remerging since I didn add the sasl USE flag, but to
	no change
<annihilator> only if i was in gui i would be able to do better lol
<colock> BTCTrader: exact command you type?  [07:57]
<BTCTrader> modprobe iwlwifi
<BTCTrader> any module will report the same thing
<Kalavera> greetings giys I am installing a server and the root partition is a lvm volume , had to
	   restart the server and now it wont recognize the format of it
<john__> annihilator: so check on my fstab?
<annihilator> ok so you did have your sda(boot partition) mounted when you setup your grub and
	      copyed the bzImage over?  (if you did /boot/kernel
<john__> I did mount boot.  [07:58]
<Kalavera> is there anything I can do to recover it without having to recreate the logical volume?
<john__> I am reloading the livecd now.
<annihilator> ok and your grub what does it show for boot
<annihilator> ok
<annihilator> i use grub2
<annihilator> but when i used grub i did /boot/bzImage
<annihilator> cause i was to lazy to rename bzImage
<john__> When I compiled my kernel I just named it kernel-3.4.9  [07:59]
<annihilator> your bzImage file you renamed?
<annihilator> cause if you did not copy the bzimage file over to your boot it will not boot right

<john__> I am running a 64-bit system.
<annihilator> but it MUST be in your boot directory and listed for grub to use
<john__> I ran file on kernel-3.4.9 and it says it is a x86 boot executabl bzImage  [08:05]
<annihilator> ok
*** s0ra_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as sora_h
<john__> That might be wrong though.
<annihilator> the only thing i can suggest to start at is     make && make modules_install && mount
	      /dev/sda1 /boot && cp /usr/src/linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot  [08:06]
<annihilator> doing that in your /usr/src/linux directory
<john__> I mounted the disks already./
<annihilator> well change the /boot (the one for the cp command)  to /boot/kernel-3.4.9  [08:07]
<john__> I compiled out LKM support in my kernel.
<annihilator> yea but its a security thing
<annihilator> do you have a straight partition setup or a lvm?
<john__> I have a hw raid0.  But it looks like one disk to gentoo.
<john__> so I have sda, sda2, sda3  [08:08]
<annihilator> you should sda1
<annihilator> sda2 and sda3
<john__> Mistype
<annihilator> lol ok
<john__> sda1 is there
<annihilator> scared me
<annihilator> but just rerun the command(s) i sent
<annihilator> its not gonna hurt
<annihilator> and it will make sure that the bzImage is correct in your boot directory
<dagerik> in which overlay does this belong to? http://euscan.iksaif.net/package/app-misc/gcalcli/
											      [08:09]
<annihilator> it will be the best place to start without starting over
<john__> Where do I have to run that from?
<john__> I see it.
<meingtsla> dagerik: Says it right there. It's in the sunrise overlay
<john__> Is it OK to not have LKM enabled in the kernel for this?  [08:10]
<annihilator> i dont module
<khayyam> dagerik: sunrise  [08:11]
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v ABCD
<annihilator> there are a few modules i have oonly needed for one thing during boot thats it lol
<annihilator> but no
<john__> I re-enabled it for now.
<john__> Otherwise make_modules bitches.
<annihilator> um  [08:12]
<annihilator> make modules_install is easier
<john__> make modules_install I mean.
<annihilator> lol
<john__> It fails.
<annihilator> ah....
<john__> Without LKM support.  which I guess makes sense.
<annihilator> enable in kernel and rerun wat i gave u
<john__> Is gentoo worth the hassle?
<john__> I am running it now.  [08:13]
<annihilator> imo yes
<john__> What do you like about it?
<BTCTrader> when using genkernel is make install required after make modules_install?
<annihilator> i only at terminal no de yet but i like the fact u dont need renistall to fix most
	      problems  [08:14]
<john__> Cool.
<annihilator> arch seems good but not my taste lol
<john__> I had arch before.
<john__> It was a pin.
<john__> pain*
<john__> I used gentoo a while back but am struggling to get started again.
<annihilator> i only reinstalled gentoo once cause of id10t  [08:15]
<khayyam> BTCTrader: 'make install' copies the bzImage and System.map to /boot ... if /boot is
	  mounted then you can do this ... this should be the same with genkernel or not
<annihilator> my 11 installs where from funtoo
<BTCTrader> ok
<funfool> annihilator,  pebkc comes to mind   :P
<annihilator> a gentoo based system built almost identicle but my e17 obsession and id10t portage
	      breaks screwed me up  [08:16]
<john__> I think e17 is awesome but have no idea how to get started with that yet.
<john__> It will be awhile since I cannot even get gentoo to boot.  [08:17]
<annihilator> the easiest i found is with one of 2 scripts
<annihilator> but that is my problem still cause i got e17 to work on funtoo but then i went to
	      start installing some programs and ended up deleting my compiler and a few other
	      components....  [08:18]
<annihilator> dont ask how
<john__> LOL
<john__> At least you can boot.
<annihilator> that was when i switched to gentoo i got it up on my first attempt and then when to
	      installed e17
<annihilator> well i borked not only portage but my drivers  [08:19]
<john__> Can you get compiz to work with e17?
<annihilator> and the system as a whole cause of some crazy setup i did
<annihilator> yes (according to youtube videos)
<john__> Could this boot be a problem with my hw raid?  [08:20]
<annihilator> oh now i remember i mixed to much unstable with stable
<john__> It should be transparent.
<annihilator> shouldnt bee if you have the raid drivers installed
<annihilator> in the kernel
<john__> I might.
<john__> Who knows.
<annihilator> which i ASSumed you did
<annihilator> ....well if not
<annihilator> then this will be pointless
<john__> It wouldn't find the kernel image otherwise.
<john__> Which it seemed to.  [08:21]
<W0rmDr1nk> where can I find : jre-6u33-linux-x64.bin  [08:22]
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<W0rmDr1nk> cos its no longer available from oracle site (I think)
<annihilator> true
<annihilator> no
<annihilator> not true
<annihilator> if grub is installed in the mbr of the raid  [08:23]
<john__> grub loads ok
<john__> i see the splash screen.
<annihilator> then yes it can install and if boot was done right but drivers not installed then it
	      will stall or kernel panic
<john__> If i muck with the options at boot it says file not found
<annihilator> lol  [08:24]
<john__> But I can get it to find the files just hang.
<john__> So I may not have a raid driver.
<annihilator> yea it sounds more like driver problems
<john__> How do I tell which raid driver I need?
<annihilator> google will be a start but i can try and help
<khayyam> W0rmDr1nk: see bug 431692  [08:25]
<john__> Is there a way to get the hardware list through the livecd?
<willikins> khayyam: https://bugs.gentoo.org/431692 "dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin: Version bump to
	    1.7.0.6 (cannot download 1.7.0.5 anymore)"; Gentoo Linux, Ebuilds; IN_P; cnyegle:java
<annihilator> let me pull up menu
<annihilator> lscpi
<colock> john__: lspci -k  [08:26]
<annihilator> i stand corrected
<annihilator> but at least i had the right command
<W0rmDr1nk> khayyam, thats not the version I'm looking for
<john__> Intel Corporation 82801 Sata Controller in RAID mode.
<khayyam> W0rmDr1nk: ok, you didn't provide the package name .. what package are you looking for?
<colock> annihilator: it's not long I know the mighty '-k' option of lspci myself :P
<colock> john__: it should also list kernel drivers and modules used  [08:27]
<colock> when used with -k option
<W0rmDr1nk> khayyam, jre-6u33-linux-x64.bin for dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.33-r1
<annihilator> in the kernel go to device drivers
<annihilator> then multiple device driver support (raid and lvm)  [08:28]
<annihilator> that should be selected
<john__> ahci is the module?
<annihilator> ?
<annihilator> you should not see achi  [08:29]
<annihilator> oh you are still in the iscpi
<khayyam> W0rmDr1nk: ok, this hasn't been reported, you could keyword 1.6.0.34, which hopefully you
	  can fetch
<W0rmDr1nk> think I found it -
	    http://raveldata.artifactoryonline.com/raveldata/list/ext-binaries-local/jre-6u33-linux-x64.bin
<annihilator> achi is the driver for the hdd
<annihilator> that is correct
*** pilojo (pilojo@unaffiliated/pilojo66) is now known as pilojo|away
<annihilator> once you get in the menuconfig let me know
<john__> Is that the raid driver as well?  [08:30]
<john__> I am in it now.
<annihilator> ok go to device drivers
<annihilator> achi enabled would explain the hdd detection correctly
<annihilator> but i bet its stalling cause its not correctly seting up the system with the raid
	      setup
<annihilator> and then go to the multiple device driver support under device drivers  [08:31]
<way2lewd> How big generally should boot partitions be nowadays? Handbook says 32m but that seems
	   small
<john__> All RAID options have an *
<john__> All but the experimental one.
<annihilator> ok
<annihilator> i do 500m way2lewd  [08:32]
<Frigolit> way2lewd: i go for like... 64MB if i even make a boot partition
<annihilator> 500m is a bit high but i dun care lol
<john__> I am not sure where AHCI is.
<annihilator> exit out of the multiple devce....
<annihilator> then its just above it
<annihilator> under sata....
<khayyam> way2lewd: 32mb is enough ... it depends on what you plan to keep arround  [08:33]
<john__> Ok
<john__> I guess i have everything
<W0rmDr1nk> ffs  [08:35]
<W0rmDr1nk> oracle sux balls - how is it that they change package without changing version ;(
<john__> So what should I do about fstab?
<annihilator> make sure you file partition type is correct  [08:36]
<annihilator> for boot and for root
<way2lewd> Frigolit: This isn't dual boot so it doesn't really need one.
<john__> ext2, and ext3
<way2lewd> true*
<annihilator> oh john__ did you make sure the file system partion drivers are included
<annihilator> john__: did you format your root partition in ext3?
<john__> Like ext2, and ext3?
<annihilator> or did you do 4 or xfs
<john__> Yes
<john__> 3  [08:37]
<john__> Wasn't sure what was best.
<john__> So I went 3.
<annihilator> and and instead of /dev/root it says /dev/sda3
<W0rmDr1nk> and this is just awesome: Linux x64	0 MB  	  jdk-6u34-linux-x64-demos.tar.gz
<john__> Yes/
<annihilator> and boot as well  [08:38]
<annihilator> ok
<annihilator> and in the menuconfig you enabled ext2 right?
<john__> sda2 is root
<annihilator> ok?
<john__> I mean swap
<khayyam> W0rmDr1nk: its a very quick demo :)
<annihilator> yea
<john__> sda3 is root
<annihilator> ok
<john__> ext2 and 3 are enabled
<annihilator> you sure lol?
<john__> Yes
<W0rmDr1nk> khayyam, must be - but it also wont match digest ;(
<john__> and 4
<john__> Should I do something more with grub?  [08:39]
<annihilator> ok cause i made that mistake
<john__> Should I do grub2?
<annihilator> your setup pretty well for the most part
<annihilator> if i was in a gui i could just shoot ya a copy of my fstab and grub and all that
											      [08:40]
<khayyam> W0rmDr1nk: understandably
<way2lewd> john__: Yeah, I think most people recommend grub2 now, you don't have to though.
<W0rmDr1nk> ugh, anybody mind sending me jre-6u33-linux-x64.bin if they have it
<annihilator> grub2 is a pain
<john__> I can't get grub to work.
<annihilator> if you dont have grub booting right
<john__> root (hd0,)
<john__> root (hd0, 0)
<annihilator> ...
<annihilator> lol it should be root (hd0,0)
<annihilator> no space in the ()  [08:41]
<john__> kernel /boot/kernel-3.4.9 real_root=/dev/sda3
<annihilator> delete the real_
<john__> initrd /boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.4.9-gentoo
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v dabbott
<john__> Does that sound right?  [08:42]
<john__> I deleted the real_
<annihilator> are you using initrd?
<annihilator> did you use genkernel?
<annihilator> or did you manually compile the kernel?  [08:43]
<john__> I did the first time and it was broken.
<john__> This time I manually compiled.
<annihilator> ok i would just for sake put a # infront of the initrd
<annihilator> and then reboot
<annihilator> cause i dont use initrd
<john__> Ok.
<annihilator> no need cause manual compiling does not use initrd
<annihilator> only if it was pure genkernel
<john__> I see
<john__> Why is it like that?  [08:44]
<annihilator> if you look in the quick guide it even says only to use it if using initrd
<annihilator> otherwise dont use it
<john__> I am rebooting.
<annihilator> ok
<john__> The guide seems to be a little outdated
<annihilator> the quick guide is not really outdated
<annihilator> the examples are a bit with the kernel
<john__> .Maybe I used the wrong one.
<john__> http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml  [08:45]
<john__> Is that right?
<annihilator> john__: i went to gentoo.com install guide then did quick install
<annihilator> it was a lot easier to understand
<annihilator> but you may want to start over.....using that guide if this does not work  [08:46]
<annihilator> and then manually config the kernel to begin with
<john__> Still hung.
<john__> Damnit.
<annihilator> you might just want to start over....  [08:47]
*** ChanServ (ChanServ@services.) has changed mode for #gentoo to +v danblack
<annihilator> and we can go step by step together
<annihilator> let me get on my kindle and so i can see the guide with you
<john__> Wow.
<john__> Thanks for the help.
<john__> I appreciate it.  You do not have to do that.
<annihilator> well if you use the quick install guide  [08:48]
<annihilator> it should only take about 10-15minutes lol
<john__> Oh ok.
<annihilator> excluding emerge compiling
<john__> Rebooting into the CD.
<annihilator> ok
<john__> Going to delete some partitions.  [08:50]
<annihilator> hey
<annihilator> before you start
<annihilator> make sure you get the guide up
<annihilator> so we are on the same page
<john__> What size should I make the partitions?  [08:51]
<annihilator> your choice on the boot
<john__> I am on preparing the disks.
<annihilator> an swap
<john__> Not sure what is a good recommended size.  [08:52]
<john__> like 32MB boot and 512MB swap?
<annihilator> i made my boot 500mb and my swap is 6016
<annihilator> your swap recommended at least twice your ram
<annihilator> boot can be 100mb if you wanted  [08:53]
<PhotoJim> I'd make /boot bigger... I make mine 100 MB unless I'm installing on a machine with very
	   little disk space.  250 MB wouldn't be overkill either.
<annihilator> PhotoJim: 500mb
<annihilator> there you go
<PhotoJim> if I even bother making a separate /boot ... I often don't.  I do on machines that hate
	   big disks. :)
<annihilator> i kinda wish i didnt
<colock> i *always* do separate /boot
<annihilator> i do a seperate boot but it kinda sucks this time around lol
<colock> it's nice to i.e. change distribution, launch installation media without the actual media
	 and so dar  [08:54]
<annihilator> john__: what size you making?
<colock> at least you can boot
<annihilator> true
<annihilator> im in irssi
<john__> 100MB boot
<annihilator> ok
<john__> I have 12GB ram
<annihilator> so just do 6016 lol
<annihilator> you dont need double that
<john__> 6MB?
<john__> 6GB?
<annihilator> between 3-6gb
<annihilator> i would recommend  [08:55]
<mikaj> do u even need swap with 12GB ram?
<annihilator> would recommend it
<ccherrett> has flash been removed from portage?
<PhotoJim> never hurts to have swap, but having 2x RAM is probably overkill.  I'd put a gig or two.
<annihilator> no
<ccherrett> I just emerge --sync
<ccherrett> and eix-update and there are no entries for flash  [08:56]
<annihilator> PhotoJim: i use double ram upto 6gb swap max
<annihilator> ccherrett: do adobe-flash
<annihilator> its there
<john__> Ok
<PhotoJim> annihilator: seems reasonable enough.
<ccherrett> annihilator: No matches found.
<john__> So I have /dev/sda1 marked as bootable with 100MB
<john__> ID 83
<annihilator> ok
<john__> sda2 id 82 at 6GB
<annihilator> ....
<john__> sda3 remainder id 83  [08:57]
<annihilator> 83 is xfs
<annihilator> not ext2 or 3
<ccherrett> annihilator: I just updated a few minutes ago
<annihilator> ok
<john__> 83 is Linux it says.
<annihilator> i did emerge adobe-flash
<annihilator> and if found it
<annihilator> yea
<annihilator> but fdisk guide 83 is xfs standard lol
<annihilator> i prefer xfs anyways
<annihilator> you can change it tho to ext2
<khayyam> ccherrett: its a known bug, see: Bug 432478  [08:58]
<willikins> khayyam: https://bugs.gentoo.org/432478 "app-portage/eix-0.26.3 : issue finding
	    PORTDIR?"; Portage Development, Tools; IN_P; josef.95:vaeth
<john__> xfs for what partition?
<ccherrett> ok thank you
<annihilator> boot and root
<ccherrett> annihilator: indeed it did find it with emerge
<annihilator> mkfs.xfs
<ccherrett> thanks
<annihilator> np
<john__> xfs, why?
<john__> No ext4?
<annihilator> imo faster
<colock> xfs
<annihilator> think of xfs as a live partition
* colock is on xfs almost everywhere
<annihilator> it can be changed and corrected on the fly  [08:59]
<annihilator> think of ext4 with partition magic
<annihilator> lol
* ccherrett updated eix
<khayyam> ccherrett: it should be fixed by the weekend ... otherwise use the fix provided in the
	  bug, re-emerge, and run eix-update
<ccherrett> ok cool
<ccherrett> thanks
<khayyam> chithead: yw
<khayyam> ccherrett: yw
<annihilator> xfs also has a faster journaling system than ext4
<annihilator> brb john__ hold off for a min if you can
<annihilator> or as colock for xfs formating help  [09:00]
<john__> I will go xfs.
<john__> Can I leave the id 83?
<annihilator> yes
<annihilator> 83=xfs
<annihilator> if you do mkfs.xfs
<annihilator> if you do mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sda1
<annihilator> mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sda3
<john__> I wrote the table with fdisk.
<john__> Will do xfs.
<annihilator> let me know whe mkfs.xfs is done  [09:02]
<john__> Done.
<john__> It was fast.
<john__> ext3 took like 10 minutes yesterday.
<john__> I also mkswap and swapon sda2.
<annihilator> good  [09:03]
<john__> Now I will mount...
<annihilator> john__: xfs is fast
<annihilator> even on making it

<john__> That page.
<khayyam> W0rmDr1nk: no java here, sorry ... did you try keywording the 1.6.0.34?  [09:10]
<annihilator> john__: that is perfect
<W0rmDr1nk> khayyam, yeah - also failed digest
<john__> Unpacking the stage3.
<john__> Done
<annihilator> follow that for the stage and portage and ill be right back
<khayyam> W0rmDr1nk: I see .. you should report this issue on b.g.o  [09:11]
<annihilator> back  [09:12]
<Alexi> clear
<john__> Everythign extracted.  [09:13]
<annihilator> portage?
<john__> Yep
<john__> Doing the mounting.  [09:14]
<annihilator> ok chroot
<john__> Done  [09:15]
<annihilator> timezone
<annihilator> and hostname set
<annihilator> i did emerge --sync before kernel install  [09:16]
<exile777> i just installed gentoo, and when it's booting it says mounting /run... mount: wrong fs
	   type blah blah blah
<exile777> what part of the handbook did i skip?
<annihilator> kernel config  [09:17]
<Alexi> perhaps editing the /etc/fstab file?
<exile777> hmmm
<annihilator> that too
<john__> Ok hostname set  [09:18]
<Alexi> yeah,  include IN Kernel, the AHCI Sata driver, if you have a Sata drive.
<john__> Kernel time.
<annihilator> lol
<khayyam> exile777: missing CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y and CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y in the kernel  [09:19]
<john__> I did not do emerge --sync
<john__> shit
<annihilator> oh well
<john__> I can still do it now.
<annihilator> dont worry
<john__> Right?
<annihilator> its auto whith ur first emerge
<exile777> khayyam: thank you  [09:20]
<khayyam> exile777: yw
<annihilator> but i just like doin it still
<john__> Don't I need to setup the compile options.
<john__> And USE_FLAGS?
<annihilator> nope
<john__> Why?
<annihilator> not needed with kernel
<Alexi> can do that later.
<annihilator> i do flags after i get boot  [09:21]
<annihilator> not before
<john__> That makes sense I guess.
<annihilator> well flags r a waiste of time
<annihilator> if u cant get machine to boot
<john__> True.
<john__> So I have to go through and set up all the kernel options.  [09:22]
<annihilator> yes
<annihilator> i recommend it
<annihilator> but hold up
<john__> Ok.
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<annihilator> if you want what i can do
<john__> I am still emerging the source.  [09:23]
<annihilator> is get you a paste file of my config
<annihilator> and so you have a text file template
<john__> I have different hardwar.e
<annihilator> of what i have
<annihilator> i said template
<john__> LOL
<john__> Right.
<annihilator> its not the conf file itself
<annihilator> its just a text file to read and compare
<john__> That would be cool.
<Alexi> "kernel seeds" on the web, has some starter .configs for beginners.  [09:24]
<annihilator> http://bpaste.net/show/42047/
<annihilator> yea
<annihilator> i always prefer to start fresh
<annihilator> text templates only no actual config templates  [09:25]
<annihilator> john__: did you set your processor type in the kernel?
<john__> Not yet.
<annihilator>  last time
<john__> Installing sources.
<annihilator> i ment wat did*  [09:26]
<annihilator> meaning last time u setup
<john__> Oh.
<john__> Not sure now.
<john__> I am in the menuconfig.
<annihilator> ok
<annihilator> u see my link
<john__> I do.
<annihilator> thats my conf
<exile777> so devtmpfs must be relatively optional. my system is booted. whats it needed for?
											      [09:27]
<john__> Not sure how to find all of the options.
<annihilator> john__: what you could do
<john__> I am removing LKM
<john__> And ramfs.
<annihilator> is save the all the txt in a .config file
<annihilator> and then load it  [09:28]
<funfool> exile777,  just little things like udev
<annihilator> then change it all to fit you
<Alexi> exile777: becuause of udev changes recently
<annihilator> i have the basics already setup that you need
<annihilator> for the most part is just change the procesor and drivers
<khayyam> exile777: its a filesystem for the likes to /dev and /run
<khayyam> exile777: s/to/of
<exile777> yeah, those are the other ones that wouldnt start. udev and stuff  [09:29]
<annihilator> you understand what i said john__
<john__> How do I dump this to text so I can do it quicker based off of yours?
<exile777> ok, need to reboot. brb
<sfmasa> Hello all
<annihilator> exit the menuconfig
<annihilator> and then in the linux directory do nano .config
<annihilator> then select all the text  [09:30]
<john__> I see.
<annihilator> and past in the file you just did in the terminal
<john__> You mean your file?>
<annihilator> yes
<annihilator> so the bpaste website
<Azerthoth|D> easier to select all the text here http://bpaste.net/raw/42047/
<john__> How do I copy all through links?
<annihilator> open the link up
<Azerthoth|D> otherwise the line numbers will still be there  [09:31]
<annihilator> thx Azerthoth|D
<sfmasa> I just installed stage 2 following handbook and for some reason USE flags in /etc/make.conf
	 aren't working... I've had to use /etc/portage/package.use instead.  Any idea what I
	 missed? Thanks
<annihilator> john__: just take that text from what Azerthoth|D basted and make a .config file in
	      the linux folder
<john__> Stupid links stuff.  [09:32]
<john__> How do I select all and copy
<annihilator> john__: crt+a inthe webbrowser
<annihilator> then crt+c  [09:33]
<john__> In links?
<annihilator> Azerthoth|D: think u can help him
<annihilator> i need to get my 2mnt old to sleep
<annihilator> afk for about 10 min  [09:34]
<khayyam> sfmasa: see 2.b "The Stage3 Tarball"
<sfmasa> khayyam: Thanks! I was afraid it would be missing something simple.  [09:35]
<john__> I am not sure you can copy and paste in links.
<khayyam> sfmasa: still, you should use a stage3
<sfmasa> khayyam: er... I used whichever one is still supported.  [09:36]
<sfmasa> khayyam: sorry, it's been a sleepless week/.
<khayyam> sfmasa: well, stage1 and stage2 are depreciated ...
<sfmasa> khayyam: I definitely did the stage 3  [09:37]
<khayyam> sfmasa: oh, you said 'stage 2" above
<sfmasa> khayyam: yeah i know, sorry.
<john__> I may just have to do this manually.
<khayyam> sfmasa: ok, so make.conf has been relocated to /etc/portage/ and this file has priority
											      [09:38]
<exile777> whaaaaaat? everythings different!! i have to learn portage all over  [09:39]
<khayyam> sfmasa: I'm fairly sure the handbook has been updated to reflect this change
<exile777> i think i accidently did the 2004 handbook  [09:40]
<khayyam> exile777: its not called gentoo anymore :)
<Azerthoth|D> john__, wget http://bpaste.net/raw/42047/
<exile777> hahah
<sfmasa> WOW I'm an idiot.
<Azerthoth|D> john__, the file will be called index.html cp it to /usr/src/linux/.config  [09:41]
<sfmasa> khayyam: Yup, I forgot about the /etc/portage/make.conf.  Thanks!
<khayyam> sfmasa: np .. yw
<exile777> but i think i edited the make.conf in /etc/ and it looks like it still worked. everything
	   i emerged had march=core2 in it
<Azerthoth|D> thats annihilators config
<khayyam> exile777: /etc/make.conf is still supported
<khayyam> exile777: but the prefered location in now /etc/portage  [09:42]
<sfmasa> bye all
<john__> I am stupid.
<john__> I should have thought about that.
<john__> Thanks Azeroth|D
<exile777> ah... thats funny, it puts an example one in /etc/ but not in /etc/portage interesting

<exile777> bbl  [09:44]
<Alexi> coxie, vlc *Might* be able to, it can play streams  [09:45]
<Alexi> if you get the address of the stream, and put it into vlc, that may work  [09:46]
<khayyam> Alexi: accept its over daap, and mostly this is a closed book
<Alexi> Ok, theres a USE flag "daap", and banshee & rhythmbox support that.  [09:48]
<khayyam> Alexi: yes, that will allow media-sound/mt-daapd ... but apple changes the methodology
	  every release so its likely not to work  [09:49]
<Alexi> righto.
<Coxie> Hmmm  [09:50]
<Coxie> What about wine? Is there a version of iTunes that works ok under wine?
<khayyam> Coxie: you can try however, I don't mean to discourage
<khayyam> Coxie: thats really OT
<Coxie> khayyam: OT?
<khayyam> Coxie: off topic  [09:51]
<Alexi> Can you perhaps play iTunes streams also from a web browser?
<Coxie> khayyam: Ah, yeah, just thought someone might know off the top of their heads
<Coxie> Alexi: I dunno, depends on the station I think  [09:52]

<john__> Yes sir.
<annihilator> go to the bottoome

<john__> No.

<exile> ok, i will have to install gpm and find my mouse
<annihilator> lol
<annihilator> ...
<john__> I will need to load your config.
<annihilator> then customize it  [09:55]
<annihilator> after that the quide will guide you the rest of the way
<annihilator> i have to go...

<khayyam> nawks: yes, I imagine it would ... actually, the usb3 issues I've read exhibit this exact

<nawks> khayyam: it was working for a few weeks.  i've been through a few kernels in that time.  now
	its crashing.  maybe irq was reassigned in that time too  [11:14]
<khayyam> john__: the obvious starting point would be the PCI section in your kernel .config

<LSD`> Most PCI systems normal people encounter aren't hotplug, so I'd assume it'd be safe to
       disable, but if it's being enabled as a dependency of something else then you may as well
       leave it as-is
<LSD`> keven: amd64, most likely
<nawks> LSD`: i've got no on that.  thanks
<nawks> maybe it has to do with boards that have some bios type rom on them
<nawks> and can be hotplugged  [11:42]
<LSD`> nawks: Oh, I thought that was the one you were saying was hard-enabled
<LSD`> nawks: IO-APIC refers to the interrupt controller, I was just assuming it's a part of the
       larger PCI hotplug picture

<nawks> eix laptop-mode ... ok i see it... local  [12:59]
<nawks> khayyam: i just found something completely retarded...
<nawks> 16:       1724    1134762   IO-APIC-fasteoi   nvidia  [13:00]
<nawks> 44:          0          0   PCI-MSI-edge      xhci_hcd
<khayyam> nawks: what is that the output of?  [13:01]
<nawks> cat /proc/interrupts
<nawks> what is retarded is that nvidia driver doesn't use pci msi ints by default
*** sora_h (~sora_h@sorah.jp) is now known as s0ra_h
<nawks> nvidious driver grrr...
<nawks> well, perhaps same for nouveau driver...  [13:02]
<nawks> To enable the Nvidia driver to use MSI create a file: /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf containing
	these lines:
<nawks> options nvidia NVreg_EnableMSI=1
<nawks> options nouveau msi=1
<khayyam> nawks: in the words of Linux "F**K YOU Nvidia" :)  [13:03]
<khayyam> nawks: s/Linux/Linus/
<nawks> ya  [13:04]
<khayyam> nawks: at least you don't have an 'integrated' GPU ..  [13:05]
<nawks> ok, shutdown xorg, reload nvidia, try to crash system...  bbiab
<khayyam> later
<nawks> khayyam: 48:          3        156   PCI-MSI-edge      nvidia  [13:18]
<nawks> thing is, xhci_hcd was using pci-msi int, so there shouldn't have been any conflict between
	nvidia and that usb3 card
<nawks> i dont even understand what those legacy pci interrupts mean for pcie, because pcie doesn't
	have any int pins  [13:19]
<nawks> it somehow emulates the legacy interrupts  [13:24]
<hesperaux> Is there any long term detrement to building a 5-drive raid5 array with one drive
	    initially missing? Talking about md raid  [13:27]
<nawks> if a drive dies your array is dead  [13:28]
<nawks> just make it 4-drive.  you can grow it to 5 later  [13:29]
<hesperaux> will growing it to 5 later cause inconsistency in the parity layout?  [13:30]
<nawks> it fixes that when it grows it.  it rebuilds it  [13:31]
<khayyam> well, 3.5.2 just crashed on me  [13:33]
<hesperaux> ok
<khayyam> thats after on six hours of use :P
<hesperaux> is there a chance of losign the data during growth re-ordering of the array?
<nawks> i'm not sure.  you'll have to read the docs  [13:34]
<nawks> i think they've made it so it is pretty safe though  [13:35]
<hesperaux> ok, thanks for the help. i'll take a look at the docs  [13:37]

<DLPeterson> anybody here have experience with both gentoo & funtoo and have any strong opinions?
											      [14:28]
<Azerthoth|D> whats gentoo?  [14:29]
<Azerthoth|D> :)
<a3li> a file manager
<DLPeterson> a fancy gelato.  [14:30]
<DLPeterson> made with baby penguins.
* frostwork prefers worker over gentoo
<epitamizor> i tried funtoo but i never really like source based distros  [14:31]
<Azerthoth|D> I use both and I really have no strong opinions either way, both have differing
	      advantages  [14:32]
<epitamizor> didnt notice any difference as far as mechanics
<oohy9n> khayyam i think i will try courier-imap
<oohy9n> it just seems easier to set up
<khayyam> oohy9n: ok ... hehe
<nawks> long reboot khayyam
<khayyam> nawks: had a problem and ended up recompiling the kernel  [14:33]
<epitamizor> but if i needed to chose source distro I would go with funto over gentoo
<khayyam> nawks: uksm did a nasty oops
<khayyam> nawks: didn't help that I was doing a backup at the time :)  [14:34]
<nawks> system is stable, no usb3 crash now that nvidia is using msi
<khayyam> nawks: goodie
<nawks> i guess i should post to that gentoo thread  [14:35]
<khayyam> nawks: thats probably a good idea ...
<DrEeevil> DLPeterson: we can't support funtoo here as they lack what we would consider basic QA
											      [14:36]
<DrEeevil> that being said, funtoo is mostly gentoo rebranded, so why not use the original ...
<chithead> funtoo comes with pre-broken ~arch stages  [14:37]
<DLPeterson> DrEeevil: i've been using gentoo and have been happy, I just got a new SSD drive and
	     was trying to decide whether to try something slightly different or just stick with
	     what I know works :)
<tdr> oh the special features
<DrEeevil> DLPeterson: if you want different try exherbo ;)
<DLPeterson> sounds like I should probably just stick to gentoo
<DrEeevil> chithead: and the python eclass they use ... oh dear :)  [14:38]
<DrEeevil> DLPeterson: yes!
<tdr> DLPeterson, funtoo was meant as a testing ground for trying things out, etc.  wasn't ever
      meant to be a fork or place to convert people away from gentoo
<epitamizor> its just like the kernel tree, you can stay with the root or grow like a leaf  [14:39]
<DLPeterson> if I understand it correctly funtoo is basically just a different source tree than
	     gentoo?
<khayyam> It would be nice though if funtoo users didn't always end up in the forums with issues
	  that no-one discovers they are using funtoo *until* about the 7th or 8th post  [14:40]
<tdr> epitamizor, or apply patches to the point where it's basically an unholy mess
<khayyam> s/that/and/
<tdr> DLPeterson, they use some different startup stuff and graft some things onto the the normal
      portage tree, basically package and package manager class over rides
<DrEeevil> DLPeterson: funtoo fetches most of their things from gentoo and then adds their own layer
	   of confusion on top of that  [14:41]
<DLPeterson> yeah, I think I'll stick with gentoo.  [14:42]
<epitamizor> DrEeevil: your talking about the guy who started gentoo
<chithead> epitamizor: and then went to work for microsoft
<epitamizor> exactly  [14:43]
<tdr> epitamizor, no one mentioned the guy, just description of  funtoo.

<epitamizor> I hear apple is beating M$ now  [14:44]
<epitamizor> :)
<tdr> i hear #gentoo is about supporting a linux distribution named gentoo
<DrEeevil> epitamizor: yup, I know
<DrEeevil> epitamizor: but drobbins and I have had some differences in opinion and I've retracted
	   any support of funtoo I used to have in the past  [14:45]
<DLPeterson> so, it seemed there was some drama between "the guy" and gentoo, has that mostly been
	     resolved or is it still festering to some degree
<DLPeterson> ?
<epitamizor> I'd like to see how it pans out several years later thats for sure  [14:46]
<tdr> it already is several years later
<DrEeevil> DLPeterson: it has mostly been reduced to passive-agressive comments on blogs  [14:47]
<epitamizor> its takes years for a new sdistro to kick up though
<DLPeterson> :)
<epitamizor> and just when it kicks up another fork comes out  [14:48]
<tdr> epitamizor, funtoo is several years old too, and not the only "spinoff" of gentoo
<DrEeevil> epitamizor: oh  [14:50]
<DrEeevil> we've been merging forks  [14:51]
<DrEeevil> Sabayon has been integrating well, now pentoo is getting assimilated, and TinHat is now
	   also mostly stock gentoo
<DrEeevil> Calculate and Funtoo are the most difficult ones as far as re-socialization, err,
	   integration goes
<tdr> becoming overlays? ;)  [14:52]
<khayyam> you never know drobbins make make another "offer" :)
<Vinky> if I do cpufreq-set -g performance , it should change the governor to performance right?
	what could cause it not to?
<Vinky> kernel support is there
<DrEeevil> khayyam: he's not the one to make offers  [14:53]
<khayyam> Vinky: laptop-mode-tools?
<DrEeevil> khayyam: but if he's willing to play nice we could re-consider tolerating him among us ;)
<Vinky> khayyam, cpufrequtils
<khayyam> DrEeevil: yes, but there have been (laughable) offers made in the past
<tdr> Vinky, its listed in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors  ?
<DrEeevil> tdr: the idea is to push stuff from the overlays back into gentoo, which both sabayon and
	   pentoo do well
<tdr> DrEeevil, ok, so it's not like the distros are becoming overlays  [14:54]
<khayyam> Vinky: I ment to ask if it was running
<DrEeevil> khayyam: yes. we don't need a random person pretending to be Boss, we're doing quite well
	   being an autonomous commune
<Vinky> tdr, yes
<DrEeevil> tdr: they are, in a way, "only" overlays - but we can reduce their size a lot ;)
<Vinky> khayyam, dont have it isntalled
<oohy9n> khayyam i finally got postfix to send mails correctly with virtual mail dirs, how nub am i?
	 2 days and finally i get this working  [14:55]
<oohy9n> can i be ever pardoned for my newbness?
<khayyam> DrEeevil: heh, indeed ... I can't even read those blog posts without cringing
<tdr> Vinky, echo "performance" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor  ; cat

<khayyam> oohy9n: certainly :)
<tdr> DrEeevil, yeah, thats what i meant.
<oohy9n> khayyam after 2 days of postfix good and sound, should i attempt dovecot or courier-imap in
	 your most honest and professional opinion  [14:56]
<Vinky> tdr, khayyam argh, of course I didnt read the help or output carefully enough, need to do
	-c X  for each core  [14:57]
<khayyam> oohy9n: I though it was dovecot you had the issues with?
<LSD`> I think I switched to dovecot since it offered POP and IMAP in the same package iirc
<oohy9n> khayyam it seems postfix was the cause of my problem, however, i can send a telnet mail but
	 gmail still reports invalid mailbox
<khayyam> oohy9n: and I already stated my pref for dovecot
<oohy9n> :<
<DrEeevil> oohy9n: dovecot it easier  [14:58]
<Vinky> tdr, you unintendingly reminded me of that
<khayyam> oohy9n: sorry, whats gmail got to do with it?
<oohy9n> testing
<khayyam> oohy9n: you can't send a telnet mail becuase its SASL .. I suspect  [14:59]
<oohy9n> no no
<oohy9n> i CAN
<DrEeevil> oohy9n: so what do the logfiles tell you when it fails?  [15:00]
<oohy9n> it does not even show up
<DrEeevil> hmm, that sounds like fun  [15:01]
<DrEeevil> can you receive mail from "outside" at all?
<oohy9n> nope only telnet mail  [15:02]
<tdr> the server prob can, but can it reach the server
<oohy9n> actually
<oohy9n> let me go and check iptables
<oohy9n> port 25 right?
<DrEeevil> oohy9n: and check DNS
<oohy9n> mx resolves properly
<DrEeevil> oohy9n: smtp+tls is port 587 iirc
<oohy9n> and dns
<tdr> oohy9n, check your iptables + your router firewall if you have one
<oohy9n> ahh well there we go
*** jrgill2 (~jrgill@unaffiliated/jrgill) is now known as jrgill  [15:04]
<oohy9n> i assume port 25 is listed as smtp and 587 as submission by iptables  [15:05]
<tdr> its listed that way in /etc/services, yes  [15:06]
<oohy9n> i never poke around in /etc/services
<khayyam> oohy9n: mail message submission
<tdr> where do you think it gets those names from?
<oohy9n> a local table  [15:07]
<tdr> yes, /etc/services
<SofS_> is there a way to change the default group for /dev/vhost-net  [15:09]
<DrEeevil> SofS_: techincally yes ;) practically ... you might need to figure out how udev creates
	   it
<oohy9n> so i can send email from my desktop to the server, not the same machine, using telnet and
	 port 25  [15:11]

	 f.e looback1 with a rfc1918 address. like 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.255?  [15:14]
<needle> additional to loopback0

<oohy9n> what is this pref in that table
<oohy9n> alright thnx nawks i will try to fix that  [15:21]
<nawks> oohy9n: what is the diff between notouch and no4touchy?  [15:23]
<Azerthoth|D> a restraining order?
<oohy9n> nawks 2 diff servers  [15:27]
<oohy9n> used to be only one

<Rene> Hi all!  [16:15]
<hesperaux> Anyone know why a brand new ext4 filesystem starts out with 42G used out of 2.8TiB?
<Rene> i have a removed package on my system called net-misc/linux-igd I can't find any info on what
       this was good for, or what was replacing it.. Could someone be so kind and point me in the
       right direction finding info about it..? :-)  [16:16]

       it.. http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/net-misc/linux-igd/linux-igd-1.0.ebuild?hideattic=0&view=markup
											      [16:17]
<Kame2> hesperaux: because all inodes are created right at the beginning  [16:18]
<hesperaux> how large is an inode?
<Kame2> hesperaux: i don't know atm. not that big  [16:19]
<hesperaux> I'm just thinking that 42GiB of inodes is a lot of inodes...lol  [16:20]
<hesperaux> Better to be on the safe side I suppose
<hesperaux> don't want to run out of inodes...
<Kame2> it's not even 2% of diskspace
<hesperaux> I was just tellin someone else that in my opinion, 1% is a lot
<Kame2> it looks big, i know. that was the reason for some googling when i first used ext4 ;)
											      [16:21]
<hesperaux> hehe
<hesperaux> I know it's a necessary evil
<Kame2> right. and on a full disk, ext4 is not worth then other filesystems  [16:22]

<Gatak> according to docs:

<Gatak> look at the dmesg output: md/raid1:mdX: active with 2 out of 2 mirrors
<Gatak> lvm2 uses dm-raid with RAID1, 4, 5 or 6  [18:22]
<Gatak> or did I misunderstand?  [18:24]
<Gatak> :)
<Gatak> why use LVM onto of mdraid when raid is supported natively through device-mapper =)  [18:29]
<ss23> Is it possible for an unprivledged user with physical access to put in a USB hardware-rng
       thats been dodgied up to poison the entropy pool and cause havoc?

<mingdao> In the doc you reference, Table 4.1. RAID Segment Types has raid1 - RAID1 mirroring
											      [18:32]

	underneath  [18:33]

	    split it in two will the vg still know where to find he pv ?  [18:40]
<violetina> he/the
<Gatak> violetina: yes, becuase pvscan looks for the UUID of the PV, so the actual /dev/ link name
	doesn't matter  [18:42]

<Gatak> =) yes of course
<keven> how do i chk hw much battery is left
<keven> in my laptop  [18:44]
<Gatak> if you type pvdisplay you will see the UUID and where the different pvs belong
<Gatak> it was a while since I used a laptop with linux, but try /proc/acpi/battery/*
<violetina> Gatak: indeed ty  [18:45]
<keven> Gatak: its not thee  [18:48]
<keven> s/thee/there
<Gatak> keven: hm.. not sure then. I think there used to be some acpi modules for battery etc.
<keven> Gatak: at present i am installing gentoo from minimal installation usb  [18:50]
<mingdao> keven: With the Gentoo minimal, that's what you get ... very minimal.  [18:52]
<drhouse123>  hi all! I installed net-fs/samba-3.6.7 but it have not  own .service file. where I can
	     get it ?  [18:53]
<mingdao> keven: It's meant to boot you up and allow chrooting without any bells and whistles.
<Gatak> keven: oh. perhaps not loaded...  try modprobe battery.ko  [18:54]
<keven> Gatak: it says not found  [18:55]
<Gatak> keven: I normally boot with  http://www.sysresccd.org/ fitted on a USB stick. Works really
	well.
<\DSAFEW\> do I need my users to be in rtkit in order for it to work?
<keven> mingdao: there must be some way to see it
<Gatak> keven: I guess you are out of luck. I am not sure you can see battery status then.. how
	about using the charger cable? =)
<mingdao> keven: It's quite unwise to install Gentoo on battery power alone.  [18:56]
<AAA_awright> Yeah, I'd bet small amounts of money that that's not going to work
<mingdao> If it does, I want one of those batteries for my ThinkPads. =)  [18:57]
<keven> mingdao: i have attached power cable also  [18:59]
<keven> mingdao: i am told its battery life is 2.5 to 3 hrs  [19:00]
<Gatak> keven: but that is probably not with full cpu usage, as gentoo is all about compiling..
											      [19:12]
<Gatak> keven: with the attached cable you have no worries =)  [19:13]
<mingdao> keven: My suggestion to you is "emerge -av sys-kernel/tuxonice-sources" when it comes time
	  to get your kernel.
<Gatak> once installed you will have the acpi modules and can watch cpu performance/speed, temp and
	battery styff
<Gatak> stuff
<mingdao> keven: sys-apps/lm_sensors is for hardware monitoring user-space utilities. Then you can
	  get GKrellM or Conky for a desktop monitor, so you can watch things.  [19:14]

<mingdao> keven: http://tuxonice.net/  [19:17]
<mingdao> Tux On Ice
<keven> mingdao: is Tux On Ice an alternative kernel  [19:19]
<mingdao> keven: ls -l /usr/portage/sys-kernel/  [19:20]
<mingdao> keven: We have so (too) many choices. And you can also just use a kernel from kernel.org
	  if you know what you're doing.  [19:21]

<keven> mingdao: in my last gentoo install i just followed gentoo handbook so that's why i was
	asking if Tux On Ice is a kernel
<mingdao> keven: sys-kernel/*-sources are all kernels  [19:24]
<mingdao> keven: If you get sys-kernel/tuxonice-sources, you won't have to read/learn/study HOW-TO
	  setup your kernel to hibernate. You will need to know HOW-TO partition your disk, etc.

<feandil> Hi  [20:56]
<B-Man> hello
<feandil> I have a question regarding the owncloud ebuild and webapp-config
<B-Man> Ask away and hopefully someone will be able to help you  [20:58]
<feandil> on http://owncloud.org/support/install/, it says that the server have to own (recursively)
	  data/, config/ and apps/, giving a command for that, "chown -R www-data:www-data
	  ...". Shouldn't the ebuild contain 'webapp_serverowned -R "${MY_HTDOCSDIR}"/apps' instead
	  of 'webapp_serverowned "${MY_HTDOCSDIR}"/apps'
* feandil is trying to understand webapp-config  [20:59]
<feandil> webapp_serverowned takes an optional -R flag to recurse into subdirectories. This flag has
	  been added recently and not many ebuilds take advantage of it. Please consult the manpage
	  for more information <- which manpage ?  [21:00]
<mingdao> feandil: The manpage of the app from which you took that sentence?  [21:01]
<feandil> mingdao: it's the webapp eclass
<mingdao> for?
<mingdao> owncloud?
<mingdao> Or just webapp eclass in general?
<feandil> man webapp-config make reference to webapp.eclass(5) but I have no such entry (No entry
	  for webapp.eclass in section 5 of the manual)  [21:02]
<feandil> mingdao: in general, the sentence comes from
	  http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/webapps/webapp-eclass.xml
<mingdao> feandil: Do you think this R option should be added to the ebuild?  [21:03]
<mingdao> feandil: You might want to ask in #gentoo-dev-help, whose topic states Need help with your
	  ebuilds? Ask here
<feandil> I'm wondering if it should or not ... As I'm not sure about its impact, I can't say
<feandil> k, I'll try  [21:04]
<mingdao> feandil: You can always edit the ebuild and try it.
<feandil> true
<mingdao> feandil: Perhaps it's referring to the webapp.eclass manpage.  [21:06]
<feandil> In fact I'm currently doing that :D but as a result the installation process take a long
	  time
<feandil> as it's marking every file as 'server owned'  [21:07]
<feandil> mingdao: yes, but where can I find it ?
<g33kN> Hi. I am using postfix. The daemon dir is listed as /usr/lib64/postfix but this is never
	created on merging. Furthermore the said files are in /usr/libexec/postfix. I don't know
	alot,.. is this a bug?
<feandil> ok, found
<g33kN> 2.9.3 hardened.
<feandil> g33kN: it changed recently
<g33kN> feandil: ty.  [21:08]
<feandil> (moved from /usr/lib64/postfix to /usr/libexec/postfix)
<g33kN> Where can I go online to review changes like this between versions? Is there a place for
	gentoo or do I have to visit each programs page?  [21:09]
<g33kN> for all packages that is
<g33kN> not just postfix.
<feandil> hum, I'm not sure on how this cannal should be called by that news appeared in "eselect
	  news"  [21:11]
<feandil> eselect news read 13 -> 2012-07-23-upgrading-postfix : Daemons for >=mail-mta/postfix-2.9
	  are installed under /usr/libexec/postfix. [...]
<g33kN> hahhaha  [21:12]
<g33kN> yes I haven't checked, my only unread out of 5
<g33kN> sigh... such time lost...
<annihilator> hi all  [21:24]
<annihilator> why cant i get irssi to work under regular user?
<mingdao> annihilator: What have you done so far?
<annihilator> what you mean  [21:25]
<annihilator> im getting ready to install a de?
<annihilator> de.*&
<mingdao> annihilator: What environment are you in now?  [21:26]
<annihilator> terminal  [21:27]
<mingdao> annihilator: What does pwd output?
<annihilator> user usr or root?
<annihilator> under*  [21:28]
<mingdao> Wherever you are...
<annihilator> pwd shows /home/theannihilator
<annihilator> but how does that help with irssi?  [21:29]
<mingdao> annihilator: What have you done so far to try and use irssi there?
<mingdao> users output would be interesting probably ;)
<annihilator> i just emerged it  [21:31]
<annihilator> it works under root but not under a standard user
<mingdao> Does it say why?
<annihilator> it may
<annihilator> but i cant ready it
<mingdao> Me, neither.  [21:32]
<annihilator> lol ok do this
<annihilator> pull up an error log and then coverit with a blank paper
<mingdao> You do the hokey-pokey and you turn yourself around, that's what it's all about!
<annihilator> and then you will see what i see but cleaner
<annihilator> if i do irssi it just brings me back to theannihilator@annihilator-gentoo ~ $  [21:33]
<mingdao> Issue "irssi -c chat.freenode.net" and pastebin the output.
<annihilator> can i just do wgetpaste?
<annihilator> or should i chroot?  [21:34]
<mingdao> Are you running Gentoo?
<annihilator> yes
<annihilator> im directly in the o
<annihilator> os*
<annihilator> ok it just resets the page and says can't open  /dev/null: Permission denied
	      Segmantation fault  [21:36]
<feandil> "can't open  /dev/null" O_o  [21:38]
<feandil> ls -al /dev/null ?
<sarid> lol good luck with that
<annihilator> crw-rw---- 1 root root 1, 3  [21:39]

*** Harrold_ (~seppl@108.162.170.29) is now known as Harrold
<annihilator> feandil: i posted what it said
<feandil> yeah, and it doesn't seems normal to me  [21:41]
<annihilator> yea well that is what it says
<mingdao> annihilator: so theannihilator can't write to /dev/null
<feandil> why would /dev/null not be accessible ?
<annihilator> i guess so
<annihilator> and i dunno
<mingdao> annihilator: You have been doing some strange things the last couple of days.
<annihilator> no i havent
<mingdao> Woahkay.  [21:42]
<annihilator> lol
* feandil thinks it's amaizing that only irssi doesn't work   [21:43]
* mingdao thinks it's *not* only irssi
<annihilator> thats all i got  [21:44]
<annihilator> i dont have any thing else install atm
<frostwork> restart install from scratch then :}
<annihilator> lol
<sarid> don't you just love when you go to compile a kernel, and you decide it's going to take a
	while so you decide to go to sleep. only to wake up and realize there was a poweroutage
	after you fell asleep
<annihilator> laptop with batterybackup ftw  [21:45]
<mingdao> sarid: No, not exactly. Didn't your UPS wake you with it's annoying beeps?
<annihilator> last 10-20hrs depending on backup
<sarid> nope
<sarid> machines used as routers usually don't have battery backups  [21:46]
<annihilator> i do  [21:47]
<mingdao> sarid: If you have any type of journalized fs, just "cd /usr/src/linux && make -j7 && make
	  install && make modules_install && shutdown -r now" ;)
<mingdao> sarid: On my LAN anything with a power cord has an UPS.
<annihilator> if its electronic and not a printer
<mingdao> With the exception of laptops.
<annihilator> its got a ups
<annihilator> mingdao: my laptops got a ups  [21:48]
<mingdao> But then, we need the annihilator's 10-20hrs UPS. <:-)} (Must be a personal generator)
<sarid> yeah, kindof running on a budget though
<funfool> annihilator,  create a new user and see if it works?
<annihilator> only my 3ds ps vita and printer are on a surge
<annihilator> mingdao: thats time on my laptop  [21:49]
<annihilator> my small ups gives 10hrs with my laptop
<feandil> annihilator: just chmod o+rw /dev/null ... but that's not normal ...
<annihilator> my big ups gives 20
<annihilator> for my laptop
<sarid> i guess i'll have to find an old one at the school  [21:50]
